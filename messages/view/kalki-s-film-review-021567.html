Murde/bdid/309.html<br />
<br />
November 8, 1944 Madras, a sea-kissed sunny city founded some 350 <br />
plus years ago by an employee of the East India Company, Francis <br />
Day, the provincial capital woke up as usual as the resplendent sun <br />
rose<br />
out of the blue waters of the Bay of Bengal. To one of its <br />
citizens,named C. N. Lakshmikantham, a colorful character of <br />
considerable notoriety, a popular journalist of the 'yellow' variety <br />
it would be his last day on this planet. Only he was blissfully <br />
ignorant of it all. Indeed if someone had told him so that day-<br />
break he would have<br />
laughed it off, mixing it with some rich colorful two-letter Tamil <br />
words (the equivalent of the English four-lettered ones!) and most <br />
likely he would have slapped that bold someone! Such was the man, <br />
the<br />
earliest of yellow journalists, the prince of muck-rakers.<br />
<br />
After finishing his mundane morning chores this go-getter was on his <br />
way in a man drawn rickshaw to meet his lawyer an Indian Christian <br />
who looked more like a Shakespearean actor with his wavy hair, long<br />
side-burns and all named J. Nargunam. At that time he had only a <br />
modest practice and lived on Maddox Street, Vepery, not very far <br />
from where Lakshmikantham lived in a narrow house-lined street in <br />
nearby<br />
Purasawalkam. The client and lawyer were good friends and met <br />
almost every evening after court hours.<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham was quite a court-bird. And a big of a jailbird too. <br />
Indeed his pre-journalist life reads like a chapter from a best <br />
selling suspense thriller. He had ambitions of becoming a lawyer,<br />
something he loved but he could not afford to go to Law College.  <br />
Yet he did not forget it and read law books. He frequented law <br />
courts of Madras city and hobnobbed with small fry lawyers, <br />
briefless, breadless<br />
ones and litigants of the illiterate kind. Clever and quick-witted <br />
he soon became a law tout. Touts though prohibited by law are men <br />
who take cases and other legal matters to lawyers for a substantial<br />
'kick-back' in the fee. Patronised by briefless and struggling <br />
lawyers some touts in Madras with a smattering of legal knowledge <br />
earn more than most lawyers. They draft deeds and documents, wills <br />
and<br />
notices mostly for illiterates and some touts resort to forgery and <br />
fabricating documents very casually of course, for a stiff fee.<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham was one such tout and smart enough to argue his own <br />
cases in court. One of his shady deals involving the fabrication of <br />
a sworn affidavit created by him in a case filed against him by a<br />
leading Madras daily found him in the dock in the Madras High Court <br />
Original Sessions. During the hearing he escaped hoodwinking a <br />
posse of cops and for a while he lived a happy-go-lucky life, until <br />
the cops<br />
nabbed and brought him to trial. Found guilty he received a 7 year <br />
jail sentence and was ordered to be imprisoned at Rajamundry, then <br />
in Madras presidency and now in Andhra Pradesh. While the train <br />
taking<br />
him was crossing a river in Andhra he, hand-chained, managed to <br />
escape fooling the guarding cops and jumped from the chug-chugging <br />
train into the river below shrouded by darkness. With chains and <br />
all he swam<br />
across the big river and disappeared into the dark night. He roamed <br />
around freely for a long while until an angry girl friend tipped off <br />
the searching Madras city cops. Back in custody he was declared <br />
a 'dangerous convict' and deported to the Andamans. With an ocean <br />
surrounding this famed island prison, Lakshmikantham could not even <br />
dream of escape. He served his term until as a war security measure <br />
he along with others was set fee and shipped back home.<br />
<br />
Back in Madras, a notorious ex-convict, he avoided courts and cops <br />
for whom he had an understandable allergy! Life had to go on and he <br />
dabbled in many things. He ran a small restaurant serving meat <br />
dishes<br />
which in south India were then known as "military hotels" {Eateries <br />
serving only vegetarian food were called 'civil' hotels}. He lost <br />
in this venture and looked around for greener pastures. Soon he <br />
found<br />
one, Journalism. A profession that would bring him money, fame or <br />
more precisely notoriety, and a violent end.<br />
<br />
Around 1943 he launched a film weekly in Tamil "Cinema Thoothu". It <br />
was a different kind of magazine. Lakshmikantham did not publish <br />
articles about theories and trends in cinema and such. He filled the<br />
pages with tales of bedroom activities, amours and amatory <br />
adventures of prominent filmland figures like reigning superstar M. <br />
K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, brilliant comedian hailed as the 'Charlie <br />
Chaplin of<br />
India', N. S. Krishnan and his star wife T. A. Mathuram, successful <br />
producer S. M. Sreeramulu Naidu and many others enjoying stardom and <br />
immense popularity in south India. He ran "series" about <br />
Bhagavathar and Krishnan as a weekly feature. He wielded a facile <br />
pen and his writing was lively, punchy and enjoyable to read. <br />
Bhagavathar, a singing star was then at his zenith of his career and <br />
fame. More a singer than an actor his following was incredible.  <br />
Masses, classes, intellectuals, upper crust folks, all loved him, <br />
his music. Women<br />
adored him and many society dames threw themselves at him. Such was <br />
his charisma. At this time he was one of the most famous figures of <br />
south India, a household name.<br />
<br />
<br />
No wonder, "Cinema Thoothu", the first of its kind was a raving sell-<br />
out and copies sold at a premium. The Tamil-speaking world had <br />
never seen anything like this weekly. The south Indian society, some<br />
forty and odd years ago was conservative, old-fashioned and subjects <br />
like sex were strictly taboo and barely whispered. In such rigid, <br />
regimented atmosphere not surprisingly people loved gossip and <br />
scandal<br />
and hungered to read and know all about the goings-on behind closed <br />
doors in high places. Movie glamour had already seeped into the <br />
skin and soul of society and this wily pen-totter took a hundred-and-<br />
ten<br />
per cent advantage of it all.<br />
<br />
What was Lakshmikantham's aim in running such a magazine? He <br />
professed, at least in public to be a traditionalist with a <br />
missionary zeal to uphold the ideals and high values of ancient <br />
Indian culture.<br />
He claimed he was socially conscious reformer come to earth, to <br />
clean the stables free of sinners and seducers, adulterers and the <br />
likes. But his real aim, the sole purpose was blackmail, pure and <br />
simple.<br />
And surely it paid him ample dividends. Many actors, actresses and <br />
cinema men paid him hush money to buy his silence.<br />
<br />
Some like Bhagavathar complained to the authorities and a memorandum <br />
signed by the superstar and other victims of the blackmailer's <br />
vitriolic pen was submitted to Sir Arthur Hope the then Governor of<br />
Madras. At once he acted and the license for publication was <br />
cancelled. However Lakshmikantham was not unduly worried. He <br />
instructed his lawyer Nargunam to file an appeal to Delhi. When <br />
Delhi<br />
did not bother about "Cinema Thoothu" the resourceful fellow <br />
utilising past expertise forged and fabricated an order renewing his <br />
license! With this fake document he managed to run his paying <br />
magazine for some<br />
weeks. When the situation turned hot he gave up "Cinema Thoothu".  <br />
He searched around and soon found a tottering weekly named "Hindu <br />
Nesan". Its objective and theme were to uphold Hindu culture, <br />
tradition,<br />
values and such. It suited Lakshmikantham and he took it over.<br />
<br />
"Hindu Nesan" clicked at once and its new editor expanded his target <br />
list of victims. Besides movie people he wrote salacious scandalous <br />
stories about business magnates, prosperous lawyers and doctors,<br />
popular musicians, feudal landlords and landed gentry, press barons <br />
and idle rich, religious heads and even small fry if there was a <br />
chance to bleed them. Every scandal tinted with sex was grist to his<br />
mill and that spelt money.<br />
<br />
'Hush money' poured in and soon Lakshmikantham acquired property, <br />
like houses, land and gold and a printing press. Soon he was <br />
elevated to the status of cult figure in Madras. Most of the stuff <br />
he wrote was<br />
partly true and his writing acquired a sheen of credibility adding <br />
to his popularity. He was smart enough to know that every cupboard <br />
had its skeletons and he searched for them!<br />
<br />
Victims, like Bhagavathar tried to buy his silence but <br />
Lakshmikantham was too smart to yield to such tactics. Some again, <br />
like Bhagavathar hired hooligans to beat him up, but he the bigger <br />
hooligan of them all<br />
proved too tough, and he beat them up! One such hired goonda was a <br />
rowdy, a milkman by profession who had supplied milk to the <br />
Lakshmikantham family. His name was Nagalingam.<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham knew he had enemies of many a kind, big and small.  <br />
So for a short while he hired a bodyguard to protect him. That man <br />
was a well- known weightlifter, boxer who ran a gymnasium for <br />
sometime. He was a staunch Hindu and had played a role in Hindu-<br />
Muslim riots. He also played roles in movies as stuntman. His name <br />
was Sreenivasulu Naidu, better known as Arya Veera Seenan!<br />
<br />
"Hindu Nesan" not only became a best-selling weekly but also a much-<br />
talked about one. Of course, in most homes the crudely produced <br />
weekly printed on cheap paper, the entire contents of which were<br />
written by the wily editor himself was read on the sly, in privacy <br />
like toilets and bedrooms. But almost every adult talked about the <br />
stories in the weekly, their authenticity and all that. Though very<br />
few had seen the muck-peddler, he was almost a household name at <br />
least for a brief period.<br />
<br />
And then Lakshmikantham announced that a new sensational story would <br />
be featured from a particular date in his weekly. A no-holds-barred <br />
expose one a sensational but unsolved killing known as 'The Boat Mail<br />
Murder'. 'The Boat Mail' was a fast running train from Madras to <br />
Dhanushkodi, serving as a link for ships from India to Sri Lanka. <br />
Hence, the name. In that train, a rich banker, a moneybag, <br />
Lakshmanan<br />
Chettiar, was brutally murdered as the mail steamed its way to <br />
Madras tearing through the dark night. Who killed the wealthy man? <br />
To this day, half a century later, it remains a mystery, unsolved.  <br />
The murder<br />
rocked the province and many bigwigs were said to be behind it. The <br />
killing, a bloody one, allegedly took place in the presence of an <br />
eye-witness, a popular singer-actress, but somehow the truth never<br />
surfaced nor was it permitted, the public felt. Lakshmikantham wrote <br />
that he would reveal the names of the killers in the very first <br />
issue.<br />
<br />
That issue of "Hindu Nesan" never came out! Before it could <br />
Lakshmikantham went out of this wide, wicked world and his exit was <br />
set in motion that day, November 8, 1944!<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham had a tenant living in one of his houses. He was a <br />
hired help in type-composing in one of the top English dailies of <br />
Madras and his widowed sister-in-law kept house for him.<br />
Lakshmikantham took a dislike to his tenant, maybe because the man <br />
came from a lowly depressed community. Anyway he wanted him to <br />
vacate his house but the press-worker refused. Enraged the house-<br />
owner<br />
published titillating tit-bits in 'Hindu Nesan' about the tenant and <br />
his buxom sister-in-law who the editor suggested in his racy Tamil <br />
took good care of the man of many more things not merely the house!<br />
Consequently the two men fought in streets, exchanging blows with <br />
the scandal-sheet scribe getting knifed in the process. He also <br />
filed a case of trespass and succeeding in it he tried to take <br />
possession of<br />
his house, throwing and breaking things like mirrors, chairs and <br />
pots in the process.<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham filed a criminal complaint against his tenant for <br />
assault but the cops did not take notice of it. So he briefed his <br />
lawyer to file a private complaint against that damned low-born<br />
fellow. His name was Vadivelu.<br />
<br />
That fateful morning Lakshmikantham carried legal papers connected <br />
with this case and Nargunam and he discussed the matter, seated in <br />
the upstairs office-room of his bungalow. Then the lawyer took <br />
leave of<br />
his friend asking him to meet him later in court and he went in to <br />
get ready to go to court. Lakshmikantham walked out towards his <br />
rickshaw. The "puller" was missing for a while and then he got into <br />
the<br />
man-drawn-vehicle, destination home, sweet home.<br />
<br />
Maddox street winds along a narrow, lonely deserted curve and ends <br />
in General Collins Road, a quiet street of garden houses and <br />
spacious bungalows only on one side. The other side was vacant <br />
land, and<br />
playgrounds. In 1944 there was not much of traffic in that part of <br />
Vepery. Madras City, itself was then only a small city of some half <br />
a million people as against five million and more of today.<br />
<br />
While the rickshaw moved down that curve with no houses around, <br />
suddenly some men, - how many nobody was sure  appeared and zeroed <br />
in on the vehicle, toppling it. One of them pulled out a knife and<br />
stabbed Lakshmikantham and as suddenly as they appeared they<br />
disappeared running in different directions.<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham bleeding and groaning in severe pain got up and with <br />
his hands pressed to the wounded area, he walked back to his <br />
lawyer's house. By now, Nargunam who had heard about the stabbing <br />
from some<br />
passers-by had come out of the house. The two met on the street <br />
when Lakshmikantham told him about the attack. What did he say?  <br />
According to the lawyer's evidence in court, the Tamil word his <br />
client used was<br />
"Avan" (which means "he"). Whom did he refer to by "he"?<br />
<br />
{Years later in the early 1970s when the writer was researching on <br />
this case, Nargunam told him emphatically that the word <br />
Lakshmikantham used was "Evano!" which means "someone"! "Avan" <br />
and "Evan" are<br />
phonetically similar and that's how the confusion arose he <br />
explained. When asked why he did not tell the court, what he told <br />
the writer, Nargunam merely shrugged it all off!}<br />
<br />
Anyway, Nargunam put Lakshmikantham in another rickshaw and asked <br />
him to go to the General Hospital, the biggest at that time, a mile <br />
away. He also requested a client of his, Mr. Brew, an Anglo-Indian, <br />
who<br />
happened to pass by, to go along with the injured man. Brew <br />
followed in another rickshaw and now Lakshmikantham bleeding and <br />
bound for the General Hospital instructed his rickshaw-man to take <br />
him to the Vepery police station situated nearby.<br />
<br />
Sub-inspector Krishnan Nambiyar came out, on being informed by Brew <br />
and met the bleeding man seated in the vehicle. Now, Brew left and <br />
went about his work. What exactly took place at the station was <br />
never<br />
clear for the police version was questioned later in court during <br />
the sensational trial and a study of the trial papers does not <br />
convey the impression that the truth did not come out. Or it was not <br />
permitted to<br />
as many believed then and continue to do so to this day.<br />
<br />
According to Nambiyar, Lakshmikantham complained speaking in English <br />
about the stabbing attack on him and while he spoke Nambiyar took it <br />
all down on a piece of white paper. This was something unusual even<br />
odd, for under the police procedure and law, such complaints should <br />
be written in a book maintained for that purpose and not on bits of <br />
paper. But the cop had an explanation. As the man was too injured to<br />
have left the vehicle he took down what he narrated on a sheet of <br />
paper under the circumstances. Nambiyar had to stand, one foot on <br />
the rickshaw, paper and pad resting on his thigh, and write which <br />
would<br />
have been impossible if he had to bring that bulky book and write it <br />
all down in triplicate using carbon sheets!<br />
<br />
After he wrote it all down, Lakshmikantham read it and signed it at <br />
the bottom, or did he? If so, when and where? Indeed this <br />
important document became an issue later during the trial. And, not <br />
without<br />
reason!<br />
<br />
In that complaint, the name Vadivelu and 'another man', aged 30, <br />
were mentioned as the assailants. Lakshmikantham, however never <br />
identified, nor named his attackers at any time before he died the <br />
morning after. Indeed when he was treated at the out-patient ward of <br />
the General Hospital by Dr. A. K. Joseph, he stated that he had no <br />
idea of who his attacker was. In the register maintained by the <br />
hospital the relevant<br />
entry read "Name of assailant  Not known".<br />
<br />
Again, later, when Dr. P. R. Balakrishnan, the house surgeon who <br />
treated Lakshmikantham as an in-patient talked to him the 'yellow' <br />
journalist stated he did not know who the assailant was. If so, how<br />
did the name Vadivelu appear in that sheet?<br />
<br />
In Nagalingam, the rowdyish milkman who was later arrested and <br />
charged as the second assailant was really the person, why did <br />
Lakshmikantham mention about a person aged 30. Nagalingam had been <br />
his milkman and<br />
known him for years. If so, why did not he name Nagalingam as the <br />
second culprit? Was Nagalingam not there that morning? Vadivelu? <br />
Was he there, or not?<br />
<br />
To confuse matters there were corrections and over-writings and <br />
such, even inks of different colours in what Nambiyar wrote!<br />
<br />
{C.Ramanna, a Madras City lawyer, with a modest practice whom <br />
Vadivelu had consulted about his house tenancy problem told the <br />
writer years later a startling story which he swore was as true <br />
as 'the sun-rise<br />
every dawn'. When Lakshmikantham was stabbed that ill-fated morning <br />
alleged to be by Vadivelu, the poor press-worker was seated in a <br />
chair in his office! So, the lawyer argued it was impossible that <br />
my client<br />
Vadivelu stabbed that fellow. Why did he not tell the police about <br />
this steel-strong alibi? The lawyer had a shocking tale to tell.<br />
<br />
He did speak to the city top cops but they shut their ears, eyes and <br />
all senses. When he persisted they threatened to rope him in, <br />
arrest and charge him as accused. How? The cops had a theory.<br />
Lakshmikantham wrote about a newspaper baron and his affair with a <br />
leading singer-actress and that VIP and this lawyer were related. <br />
Besides, Vadivelu worked in that big shot's press! So, the cops<br />
hinted the baron had asked his lawyer relative to rub off <br />
Lakshmikantham and he in turn fixed up his client Vadivelu and he! <br />
The shocked lawyer raced back home and went about his other<br />
business!}.<br />
<br />
And that was not all. There were more matters creating and casting <br />
long and strong shadows of doubts in the police and prosecution <br />
version of the case.<br />
<br />
For example, the weapon, a knife, or dagger as it was described. <br />
According to the rickshawman, Gopal, he picked up the blood-stained <br />
knife and the legal papers Lakshmikantham had with him, equally<br />
stained and took them to Nargunam. Strangely, the lawyer took the <br />
papers and told Gopal to hand over the knife at the Vepery police <br />
station. Why did he keep back the papers which were also important<br />
evidence, like the knife? Nargunam could not offer any valid <br />
explanation either during the trial in the witness-box or years <br />
later to the writer.<br />
<br />
An important point he did clarify to the writer was his conduct <br />
after he saw his client with the bleeding stab injuries. <br />
Lakshmikantham had been his friend and client, and a frequent <br />
visitor to his house. Why,<br />
then did he not take him to the nearest doctor at once, or having <br />
failed to do so, why did he not accompany his friend and client to <br />
the General Hospital instead of sending Brew, ho came along that way <br />
by<br />
sheer accident? He was cross-examined during the trial by defense <br />
lawyers but his answer was far from convincing. Years later he gave <br />
the writer a convincing explanation. He found that the injuries were<br />
simple and certainly not so serious to warrant his personal and <br />
immediate attention. Moreover, he was anxious to avoid getting <br />
involved with sordid attacks on a shady character which he knew his<br />
client certainly was!<br />
<br />
His evaluation of the injuries as simple tallied with that of S. I. <br />
Nambiyar's. And, also that of the victim himself. The police <br />
officer had noted in the case register the nature of the injuries as <br />
simple,<br />
and he registered a case only for 'simple hurt' under the Indian <br />
Penal Code.<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham too should have felt the same way explaining why he <br />
chose to visit the police station first without rushing to the <br />
Hospital as urged by his lawyer.<br />
<br />
Dr. Joseph too had the same opinion when he treated the injured man <br />
at the out-patient ward.<br />
<br />
Another issue of confusion, - and doubt -, was the knife. According <br />
to the police case, Gopal handed over the weapon to Nambiyar. Under <br />
the rules the receipt of the knife should have been entered in a<br />
property register, immediately by the station clerk. But no such <br />
entry about this knife was found noted in that book! Why not? <br />
Nambiyar offered vague replies under cross-examination and ventured <br />
to<br />
suggest that such procedure was not always followed! A perusal of <br />
the Vepery police station register revealed that even insignificant <br />
items, like onions, eggs and such were recorded, but this blood-<br />
stained knife<br />
was not. Why not? Was there no such knife at all? Were Gopal and <br />
Nambiyar spinning yarns? Was the knife a fake, not the real one, <br />
but something introduced later by the cops?<br />
<br />
What of Gopal? Was he really an eye-witness to the attack, as he <br />
claimed to be. The defense case was that he had run away, scared to <br />
death as soon as his rickshaw was toppled. There is strong force <br />
behind this theory. After Lakshmikantham was stabbed he a man with <br />
knife injuries bleeding and shocked came walking groaning and <br />
moaning towards his lawyer's house. Why did he not come in that <br />
rickshaw.<br />
Was it because that Gopal was not around to help the victim, having <br />
run away to safety? Indeed Gopal came with his vehicle towards the <br />
place on the street where the lawyer and the victim stood only <br />
minutes<br />
later. All these suggest strongly that Gopal was no eye-witness as <br />
put by the police and his evidence not based on truth.<br />
<br />
However, Lakshmikantham accompanied by a cop sent by Nambiyar <br />
reached the General Hospital where Dr. Joseph attended on him and <br />
also spoke about the attack based on which he made those entries in <br />
the<br />
'casualty' register. Interestingly the prosecution did not choose <br />
to call Dr. Joseph to give evidence at the trial in spite of the <br />
pressure by the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Vere Mockett (later Sir <br />
Vere<br />
Mockett). Somewhat exasperated the honorable High Court Judge <br />
summoned this young doctor to as a court witness to tender evidence. <br />
Why did the prosecution fight shy? The explanation was unconvincing.<br />
<br />
At the GH Lakshmikantham was beginning to feel uneasy and the <br />
bleeding from the injury in the abdomen did not cease. So he was <br />
admitted as an in-patient for further treatment in the Wenlock ward <br />
under a<br />
well-known surgeon of the day, Dr. Nadkarni Mangesh Rao, one of the <br />
senior Indian doctors of Madras.<br />
<br />
Around this period Nargunam visited the hospital twice. He deposed <br />
in court that the first time he found that his friend had not <br />
reached the hospital and on the second visit, Lakshmikantham was in <br />
poor condition<br />
and taking a turn for the worse.<br />
<br />
{However, some quarter-century later the lawyer told the writer a<br />
different tale which he declared was the undiluted truth. When he<br />
went to the GH, he did meet Lakshmikantham whom he found in bed but<br />
hale and hearty. He cracked obscene jokes in Tamil about those "sons<br />
of whores" who dared to attack him. He would get out of GH in a day<br />
or two and would teach all those bastards a fitting lesson and show<br />
who Lakshmikantham really was! Nargunam laughed enjoying his <br />
friend's<br />
two-lettered Tamil abuses and left promising to visit him next <br />
morning<br />
on his way to court. His shock when he heard about Lakshmikantham's<br />
death knew no bounds for he never expected it. "I never even dreamt<br />
he would die!" he remarked his voice dropping to a heavy whisper.}<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to Lakshmikantham at the GH? Something that ended<br />
his eventful, exciting life. Something, now very clear, discussed<br />
hotly then, both in and out of courts and even today almost half a<br />
century later.<br />
<br />
When the bleeding did not stop Dr. Mangesh Rao wondered if the <br />
patient<br />
had suffered any serious internal injury like damage to the<br />
peritoneum. He felt an exploration of the abdominal wound was<br />
necessary. So he instructed his assistant Dr. P. R. Balakrishnan to<br />
do the needful as he was busy otherwise engaged in serious cases!  <br />
But<br />
the problem Dr. Balakrishnan found that the blood pressure of the<br />
patient had dropped very low and promptly he informed his senior of<br />
the condition. Dr. Rao felt that an exploration of the wound under<br />
such low blood pressure would prove fatal and told his assistant<br />
against it and suggested some treatment to stop the bleeding.<br />
<br />
Yet, Dr. Balakrishnan did perform an exploration on Lakshmikantham.<br />
Why did he do it? No answer was ever found and Dr. Balakrishnan<br />
carried the truth to his grave. He did offer an explanation but it<br />
satisfied none. Anyway his surgical exploration created another<br />
wound, the second one. This two-wound situation figured prominently<br />
at the trial casting doubts on the prosecution case. Indeed the<br />
defense openly suggested that the cause of the death was the<br />
exploration and not the stab wound.<br />
<br />
An examination of the patient's urine revealed blood, indicating<br />
damage to the kidney. There was no clear proof about the condition <br />
of<br />
the urine before Lakshmikantham was wheeled into the operation<br />
theater. What had caused the damage? The surgical exploration?<br />
<br />
Interestingly and perhaps, sadly, no defense lawyer categorically<br />
asked questions whether the blade of the knife could have reached the<br />
kidney and cut it into two! All the counsel were very eminent <br />
lawyers<br />
of standing, skills and experience but nobody pursued that line. One<br />
wonders why?<br />
<br />
The news about the attack on Lakshmikantham hit the city like a storm<br />
and crowds in large numbers gathered inside the hospital grounds,<br />
corridors and almost everywhere and police had a tough time<br />
maintaining order. It became the talk of the town, and wild stories<br />
began to circulate about the identity of the assailant or assailants,<br />
nobody was sure, not even the cops at this juncture  and the people<br />
behind it.<br />
<br />
As night fell, Lakshmikantham took a turn for the worse. He became<br />
delirious and in the early hours of the following morn, at about <br />
4.15,<br />
November 9, 1944, he died, due to secondary shock caused by damage to<br />
the kidney. It was all over. A life of stir and sensation,<br />
excitement and escapes had ended. An ex-con who had been a thorn in<br />
many a flesh, had been eliminated. A case of simple hurt had ended <br />
in<br />
murder. A hornet's nest had been stirred.<br />
<br />
Who did it? Nobody really knows.<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham had been elevated to the status of a martyr. His <br />
death<br />
rocked south India, and his funeral became an event. His body was<br />
laid on a bench in the front area of his house in Purasawalkam for<br />
public view, and thousands of men, women and even kids thronged to <br />
pay<br />
homage to him. Floral wreaths were laid at his feet, and many women<br />
who had never known or seen him wept beating their breasts wailing<br />
loudly. Mass hysteria reigned during the funeral. A poor man, an<br />
ordinary man, who took cudgels to cleanse society had been eliminated<br />
by the sinful haves, the sadistic rich, the bigwigs. That was the<br />
feeling that filled the air, as thousands followed the funeral<br />
procession. That day, C. N. Lakshmikantham, dead and cold, was the<br />
most talked-about person in Madras. A raging world war, a voilent<br />
freedom struggle, shortage of essential commodities, all were<br />
forgotten by people.<br />
<br />
Police Inspector Keshava Menon took over the investigation of the<br />
murder at once. Frankly he had no clue of any kind. Stories<br />
circulated in the Maddox street  General Collins Road area of a <br />
group<br />
of three persons, or four was seen running around the time of attack.<br />
And the hunt for that 'gang of three' began in right earnest!<br />
<br />
The police had known about the enemity between the murdered man, and<br />
the press-worker, Vadivelu. So, Menon arrested him quickly and began<br />
to work on the case. Before he did so, the cops interrogated many <br />
and<br />
for a while any group of three found walking in Vepery was treated as<br />
suspects and interrogated. Keystonish? Yet true. The answer was <br />
the<br />
cops had no clue. None at all.<br />
<br />
Lakshmikantham had many enemies. Big and small. He had known that<br />
his life was in danger.<br />
<br />
[In a chat with the writer during his research, Nargunam narrated how<br />
on many nights Lakshmikantham had requested his lawyer to walk along<br />
with him and put him in a rickshaw for he had the uneasy, but certain<br />
feeling that some tough-looking fellows, total strangers, were<br />
folowing him as he returned from Maddox street. Nargunam recalled<br />
oncehe had walked along right upto Lakshmikantham's door in<br />
Purasawalkam. The scandal-purveyor rarely came alone at nights to <br />
his<br />
lawyer's house and friend of his, a musician Gopalasami Chetty came<br />
along as a walking companion! All this happened about a month before<br />
November. Lakshmikantham, also requested his lawyer often during that<br />
period that in anything should happen to his life. Nargunam should <br />
do<br />
all he could to help his aged mother and an elder brother who had <br />
been<br />
blind for years. Lakshmikantham was greatly attached to these two and<br />
looked after them well.<br />
<br />
His wife never got on with her aged mother-in-law and took her to<br />
court for property disputes, even during the murdered man's lifetime.<br />
There were strong rumours that Lakshmikantham was never legally<br />
married.]<br />
<br />
C. V. Arunagiri Mudaliar, then Assistant Commissioner of Police,<br />
Madras was put in charge of the case by the top cop of the city, a<br />
Britisher R. C. Hume. Mudaliar, Menon and the investigating team<br />
realised that they had a difficult assignment to handle. Vadivelu<br />
offered them hope and they came to know the police, under the law is<br />
not bound to its sources of information that Vadivelu and two others<br />
were seen walking together in Vepery. The 'gang of three'? The <br />
other<br />
two men were traced and kept in the police custody. The two men, a<br />
kind of do-gooders belonging to the same depressed classes as <br />
Vadivelu<br />
did, were trying to help the poor press-worker in his legal tangles.<br />
They were benumbed with shock and stark fear when they realised that<br />
they were suspected to be involved in the murder! They were put up<br />
for identification at parades and made bold to send petitions to the<br />
higher-ups seeking justice. After a nerve-racking time they wre let<br />
off as being innocent! But Vadivelu was kept back. And, there for a<br />
while the investigation stopped. The cops could not proceed further<br />
No clues, nothing could be found.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile public opinion about the delay in the police investigation<br />
began to gather strength. Certain groups in the city held meetings <br />
to<br />
condemn the murder of a man who they considered as a moral crusader,<br />
and motives were attributed for the police tardiness, and the<br />
inability of the famed Madras City police to ban the real culprits.<br />
The police was accused of shielding the big shots of Madras who were<br />
said to be the actual culprits.<br />
<br />
Thus the Madras city police was under severe pressure from many<br />
quarters and the heat scaled the high point when a memorandum was<br />
presented to Sir Arthur Hope, by an association of government<br />
employees. The Governor of Madras, in turn, turned the valve on his<br />
officers and police top brass. Get the killers get on get<br />
someonecome on get on onon<br />
<br />
And the police did! Quickly the police arrested three more men, the<br />
milkman Nagalingam, boxer Arya Veera Seenan, and a butcher,<br />
Rajabathar. Who were these men? According to the police, Nagalingam<br />
was the other man, along with Vadivelu who attacked Lakshmikantham.<br />
Frankly all of them were small fry, also-rans. According to the<br />
police these were only errand boys. For whom?<br />
<br />
A letter gave the cops the lead, or did it? A third-rate struggling,<br />
self-styled Tamil playwright and so-called screen-writer A. K.<br />
Ramanna, a resident of Purasawalkam, wrote a letter to his friend in<br />
whose house he was a paying guest, a film actor doing small roles, V.<br />
S. Mani, then shooting at Salem. The letter, interesting and curious<br />
read as follows,"Yesterday morning at about 10.30, CNL while<br />
returning from the house of advocate Narguman in Maddox street was<br />
dastardly stabbed with a 'bichuva' in three places, and he died at 4<br />
o'clock during the early hours of the day he has been finished by a<br />
person Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, _____ came to me and<br />
informed me that he had done away with the life of CNL and warning me<br />
not to publish this news went away"<br />
<br />
This letter bore the date November 9, 1944 and reached Salem, some <br />
two<br />
hundred and odd miles away from Madras, only on the morning of 14th.<br />
When Mani received it a police officer, K. V. Venkatsubramaniam, was<br />
already seated near the actor, waiting to seize it! How? Thereby<br />
hangs a tale, a curious one indeed. Very.<br />
<br />
Ramanna's letter posted in Purasawalkam was seen by the Censor who<br />
passed on a photostat copy to the police. During the war, the <br />
British<br />
Indian government had a Censor authorised to intercept and open<br />
letters under the guise of security. But, why was this letter<br />
intercepted, opened and read? Ramanna was no terrorist, no wanted <br />
man<br />
gone underground, no alien. In fact he was a nobody. Why, then was<br />
his letter opened? Sheet chance? Telepathy? Some other reason? Or<br />
was the letter a police plant, as suggested by the defense?<br />
<br />
Ramanna was easily traced by the city police and taken for<br />
interrogation which it would appear went on for some days during <br />
which<br />
period he was kept in custody. Not strictly legal, perhaps, but<br />
that's how thing were in British-ruled India.<br />
<br />
Who was the person whose name Ramanna had left blank in his letter?<br />
Arya Veera Seenan, he told the police. Seenan, Mani and he were old<br />
friends and the famed boxer visited Mani often. Seenan also<br />
disclosed, Ramanna said, that the 'operation Lakshmikantham murder'<br />
was financed and backed by big shots of the Tamil cinema world,<br />
precisly, the reigning superstar M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, <br />
leading<br />
comedian and star N.S. Krishnan and successful producer-director S. <br />
M.<br />
Sreeramulu Naidu.<br />
<br />
The police also had knowledge of the memorandum submitted to the<br />
Governor of Madras by filmland personalities affected by the writings<br />
of the murdered muckraker in "Cinema Thoothu". The top three<br />
signatories were MKT Bhagavathar, NSK and SMS Naidu!<br />
<br />
Soon the cops picked up another young man, Jayanandan from Royapuram,<br />
a sea-side area of the city. A waster, goo-for-nothing fellow, he <br />
was<br />
the brother of a buxom, bosomy up and coming Tamil film actress Clara<br />
alias Chandra about whom Lakshmikantham had written in his weeklies.<br />
He was arrested, but later he was given 'King's pardon' and taken as<br />
approver. This man would play a key role in this trial and provided<br />
the high drama, sensations and such.<br />
<br />
[There was a successful Tamil script-writer, a box-office draw in his<br />
day, famous under his pen-name Ilangoven. He was a person of odd<br />
tastes and hobnobbed with low-types, like rowdies, riff-raff and all.<br />
He was also a good friend of Lakshmikantham's and Arya Veera<br />
Seenan's. His constant companion, bodyguard, chauffer and<br />
brother-in-law Sriramulu (The writer had two wives, both sisters of<br />
this man's!) told the writer during the late 1970's that much of the<br />
"news" in "Cinema Thoothu" and "Hindu Nesan" was based on the<br />
information mostly given by Ilangovan. Even the "hush money" deals<br />
were put through the good offices of this box-office-big shot film<br />
writer. Ilangovan and even Sriramulu were interrogated by the city<br />
police and the writer had expected to be arrested for the murder.<br />
Scared he made himself scarce for a while and surfaced only when the<br />
coast was clear! During his heyday Ilangovan's name in the film<br />
credits meant success and most of Bhagavathar's box-office bonanzas<br />
were written by him. Bhagavathar insisted that Ilangovan be fixed as<br />
writer before he agreed to sign a film. However, Ilangovan spent his<br />
last days in poverty, pain and obscurity.)<br />
<br />
And then, south India shook during December 1944, when Bhagavathar,<br />
Krishnan and Sreeramulu Naidu were arrested. The arrests, specially<br />
of the singing superstar, Bhagavathar was then at the peak of his<br />
fame, a larger-than-life figure, a legend in his lifetime almost<br />
diefied by his fans and followers, and such a person to be arrested<br />
like a lowly criminal and accused of murder! To the average Tamilian<br />
even the very thought was incredible<br />
<br />
However, the police put of a case in court for the murder of<br />
Lakshmikantham, as abetment, conspiracy and such against eight<br />
accused. After the committal proceedings, before the magistrate, the<br />
history-making 'Lakshmikantham Murder Case' came up for hearing in<br />
April 1945, at the original Criminal Sessions of the Madras High <br />
Court<br />
by Mr. Justice Vere Mockett, a British Barrister who had practised in<br />
Madras before his elevation to the Bench.<br />
<br />
Vadivelu Nagalingam Arya Veera Seenan M. K. Thyagaraja <br />
Bhagavathar<br />
N. S. Krishnan S. M. Sreeramulu Naidu Rajabathar Arumugam Eight<br />
accused in all faced the trial. Arumugam was a cop who was alleged <br />
to<br />
be one of the conspirators.<br />
<br />
The trial attracted enormous and unprecedent attention not only in<br />
India, but even beyond like Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Burma, Malaya and<br />
other land's where there was a sizeable Tamil-speaking population.<br />
Newspapers, in English, Tamil, Telugu and other languages published<br />
'verbatim' reports of the trial, day to day. Unmanageable crowds<br />
thronged the famed red-bricked Indo-Saracenic style edifice of the<br />
Madras High Court, eager to take a close look at the popular and<br />
glamorous faces in the dock, M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, an idol of<br />
the masses and classes and N. S. Krishnan both legendary figures of<br />
south India.<br />
<br />
P. V. Rajamannar, one of the legal luminaries of India, a long time<br />
Chief Justice of Madras, then the Advocate General, led the<br />
prosecution assisted by P. Govinda Menon (later, a judge of the <br />
Madras<br />
High Court, and Supreme Court of India). Arunagiri Mudaliar, who<br />
masterminded the investigation helped the Prosecution counsel.<br />
<br />
A battery of lawyers, the cream of the Bar in Madras and beyond<br />
appeared for the accused. Brilliant men of provenmerit, forensic<br />
skills, expertise and experience, like V. T. Rangaswamy Ayyangar, V.<br />
Rajagopalachari, Braddel (a Barrister from Singapore then in Madas on<br />
account of the war and Japanese occupation of that city) B. T.<br />
Sundararajan S. Govind Swaminathan and K.M. Munshi (A brilliant <br />
Bombay<br />
lawyer leading Gujerati writer, patriot-pilitician, Indian National<br />
Congress leader and after India became free, central minister and<br />
state governor).<br />
<br />
Munshi was brought from Bombay for a fabulous, unheard of fee to<br />
defend Sreeramulu Naidu and his appearance made the trial a 'cause<br />
celebre' all over India. He dominated the team of defense counsel,<br />
and in a brilliant move he raised a plea of 'alibi' for Naidu. He<br />
produced evidence based on the records of Hotel Taj, Bombay, to show<br />
and prove that during the relevant dates of the conspiracy Naidu had<br />
stayed at this famous and top hotel. The plea was successful and the<br />
prosecution filed a "Nolle Prosequi" (no prosecution) resulting in <br />
the<br />
discharge of Naidu. The producer-director-studio-owner from<br />
Coimbatore walked out a free man.<br />
<br />
Munshi was then engaged to defend N. S. Krishnan. He and other<br />
counsel fought hard for the defense investing all their talents,<br />
skills, legal acumen.<br />
<br />
The trial took an unexpected dramatic turn when the approver<br />
Jayanandam entered the witness box to give evidence. Ever since, the<br />
police picked him up on November 26th he had been a problem to the<br />
city cops. He expressed his desire to confess before a magistrate <br />
but<br />
did not do so when he was taken for that purpose. Interestingly, the<br />
police kept him in a prison at Saidapet, then outside the city <br />
limits,<br />
rather strange thing to be done. Finally he confessed on December<br />
22nd and spoke about the murder which he claimed was the truth, whole<br />
truth and nothing but the truth!<br />
<br />
His confession Nagalingam, his old friend came to him and said that<br />
arrangements had been made to do away with Lakshmikantham and it <br />
would<br />
be funded by Bhagavathar and N. S. Krishnan. As the scandal-weekly<br />
had published obscene tales about his actress-sister and him, he had <br />
a<br />
grudge against its editor. So he agreed to join his friend to murder<br />
Lakshmikantham. On November 7, 1944, he met Nagalingam and also<br />
Vadivelu, Arya Veera Seenan, Rajabathar, Arumugam. He was also<br />
introduced to one Kamalanathan, who would get the money for the<br />
murder. All went to a drama theater, then very famous, called Wall<br />
Tax Theater on Wall Tax Road. Here, they were met by a man with<br />
prominent whiskers who took Jayanandam, Kamalanathan, Seenan and<br />
Nagalingam into the 'green room' (make up room) where Bhagavathar and<br />
N. S. Krishnan were present. The details of the murder were <br />
discussed<br />
and an advance of Rs.500 was paid. The killers also took an oath of<br />
secrecy and a ritual of eating betel-leaves and salt was done by the<br />
men.<br />
<br />
Next morning Nagalingam woke him up by 4.45 am, and both went to<br />
Purasawalkam to carry out the "job" All the men assembled and moved<br />
to General Collins Road where Vadivelu and Nagalingam finished the<br />
"murder mission" so ran Jayanandam's confession.<br />
<br />
And before the Judge and jury the approver went back on his <br />
confession<br />
and told the court on oath that his confession was a tissue of lies,<br />
lies and lies, containing not even a grain of truth! He had been<br />
tortured and pressurised by the police to confess and state all that<br />
he did before the magistrate. Taken by shock and surprise, the<br />
Advocate-General had Jayanandam treated as a hostile witness and<br />
cross-examined his own 'star witness'.<br />
<br />
The other element of interest was the evidence of the city police<br />
surgeon, a professor of the Madras Medical College, a well-known<br />
person in the medical and social circles of Madras, Dr. A.<br />
Sreenivasulu Naidu. He had performed the post-mortem on the body and<br />
he underwent, a tough, uncomfortable and embarrassing time in the<br />
witness box. He gave evidence about his post-mortem, the nature of<br />
the injuries, Dr. Balakrishnan's surgical exploration, cause of death<br />
and connected issues. He was grilled mercilessly during the<br />
cross-examination by Munshi, Rangaswamy Ayyangar, Rajagopalachari and<br />
others, experts of that fine art. The heated questioning focussed on<br />
the wound caused by surgery and Dr. Naidu agreed tacitly that the<br />
exploration might have caused the death. Aware of the damage of his<br />
answers he tried to defend his colleague. But he made a poor<br />
impression as a professional witness in spite of his credentials,<br />
track record and all. When he left the box, much relieved, he also<br />
left a strong impression that he had not spoken out, as a result of<br />
trying to protect his young colleague Dr. Balakrishnan.<br />
<br />
The prosecution let in a long procession of witnesses like Gopal, A.<br />
K. Ramanna, V. S. Man his actress wife Jayagouri milkmen who <br />
claimed<br />
to be seen Jayanandam and others at the scene of crime Margunam, Dr.<br />
Mangesh Rao Dr. Balakrishnan Kamalanathan and many others. A<br />
perusal of the trial records does give the uneasy but distinct <br />
feeling<br />
that most witnesses were speaking about events they did not know much<br />
about. There was loads of prevarication, by most, and the <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>and<br />
touch of truth seemed missing. Questions in cross-examination were<br />
rarely answered directly and there was a great deal of beating about<br />
the bush.<br />
<br />
The defense too produced witnesses and some of them went into the box<br />
to support a plea of 'alibi' raised by N. S. Krishnan who claimed to<br />
have been in Salem, working on a film called "Burma Rani" (1944) at<br />
the Modern Theatres studio, on November 7th, the day of the Wall Tax<br />
theatre-make-up room meeting.<br />
<br />
After a prolonged and much publicised trial, addresses to the jury by<br />
counsel and the judge, the jury. And much to the surprise of many in<br />
court and elsewhere, the jury returned a verdict of 'guilty' in <br />
favour<br />
of Arumugam. The verdict shocked Bhagavathar and NSK. Indeed the<br />
famous comedian had expected to get a favourable verdict and his star<br />
wife, top comedienne, T. A. Mathuram had even made arrangements for<br />
distribution of sugar and sweets and a reception.<br />
<br />
The Judge accepted the verdict and awarded life imprisonment to all<br />
the accused. Appeals were filed and heard by a Bench of the High<br />
Court consisting of Sir Lionel Leach, Chief Justice, and Mr. Justice<br />
K. P. Lakshmana Rao. By now P. V. Rajamannar had become a judge and<br />
his successor as Advocate-General, K. Rajan Iyer appeared for the<br />
Crown. Again a galaxy of lawyers appeared for the accused-<br />
appellants,<br />
with V. V. Srinivasa Ayyangar, and V. C. Gopalratnam joining the <br />
team,<br />
Munshi was not in the team. VVS was one of the leading lawyers of<br />
Madras, enjoying a fabulous income. A man of culture, with a flair<br />
for fine arts, and he was a High Court Judge for a brief while, and<br />
resigned because the salary was not enough for him to live! VCG (his<br />
son-in-law) also a successful trial lawyer was a playwright, stage<br />
person and actor, prize-winning sportsman and a granary of humour and<br />
wit. (The writer was his apprentice and his junior in his chambers<br />
for a very brief while, during which he tried to learn unsuccessfully<br />
and the secret of leading a full life with some success!).<br />
<br />
However, the appeals were dismissed and sentences confirmed by the<br />
Appelate Bench and the accused disappeared behind the high walls of<br />
jail.<br />
<br />
Yet Bhagavathar and Krishnan would not give up. They filed appeals <br />
to<br />
the Privy Council in London. D. N. Pritt, the internationally known<br />
British Barrister appeared for the two movie stars. The then highest<br />
court of appeal felt that the two accused did not have a fair trial<br />
and remanded the case back to India for a fresh look.<br />
<br />
Back in Madras, the remanded appeal came up for hearing before a <br />
Bench<br />
of two judges. Mr. Justice Happel, and Mr. Justice Shahbuddin. V. <br />
L.<br />
Ethiraj, one of the most successful criminal lawyers of India, a<br />
glamorous personality in a unglamorous profession, a Barrister with a<br />
staggering success ration. (V. C. Gopalratnam wisecracked that V L<br />
stood for 'very lucky') appeared for Bhagavathar and Krishnan.<br />
<br />
He built his arguments mainly on the credibility of the approver's<br />
confessional evidence. Jayananam by going back on his confession and<br />
also his conduct before confession had proved himself to be <br />
thoroughly<br />
unreliable. To base a conviction on the uncorroberated testimony of<br />
an unreliable witness could be dangerous, Ethiraj argued. He also<br />
stressed that the evidence of Gopal, A. K. Ramanna and others was<br />
unrealiable. Ramann's letter seemed highly improbable for no sane<br />
person would rush to a casual friend and speak bout a murder he had<br />
committed a few hours earlier. Certainly not, a woldlywise man like<br />
Arya Veera Seenan. If Ramanna were a truthful man why did he leave<br />
the name of the killer blank in that letter. To put in any name<br />
later? Ethiraj also argued that the judge had not properly directed<br />
the jury and the evidence of doubtful value not properly assessed.<br />
<br />
The learned judges agreed with Ethiraj's arguments and acquitted<br />
Bhagavathar and Krishnan. The judgement was delivered in 1947.  <br />
Soon,<br />
the other accused were also set free.<br />
<br />
Bhagavathar, Krishnan and the other four, Vadivelu, Nagalingam, Arya<br />
Veera Seenan and Rajabathar came out after a 30 month sojourn in<br />
prison.<br />
<br />
The Lakshmikantham Murder Case, the prolonged trial, the prison term,<br />
appeals' aftermath and all crushed Bhagavathar and virtually tolled<br />
his death knell. He was ruined financially, psychologically and<br />
emotionally and never recovered from the shock. He made many <br />
attempts<br />
to rise life a phoenix, made films but failed miserably. Soon his<br />
health too failed and he passed away in pain and poverty. A tragic<br />
fall indeed for the mightiest Roman of the all, a sad end to a <br />
success<br />
story of incredible kind.<br />
<br />
N. S. Krishnan recovered quickly. Indeed he was his usual cheerful<br />
self even during the trial, and in prison, cracking jokes and<br />
performing a brilliant 'mimicry' show imitating lawyers, jury and<br />
judge. Even K. M. Munshi was not spared, which that creative,<br />
artistic Bombay lawyer enjoyed most, laughing uproariously! After <br />
his<br />
release, Krishnan's career zoomed, with his own films, some of which<br />
he also directed. He dabbled in politics, and his clout, cult figure<br />
status and such helped to boost his career. But somehow things were<br />
not the same as the gold old days. Within a decade, he too went down<br />
hill and dies in 1957. He died almost penniless.<br />
<br />
Vadivelu never recovered from the shock and trauma that affected his<br />
mind. He died some years ago. Nagalingam committed suicide, hanging<br />
himself from a ceiling fan. Rajabathar eked out a precarious living<br />
selling beef in Purasawalkam market and died some years ago.<br />
<br />
(The writer made many attempts to meet him and make him talk but he<br />
made himself scarce. He felt that the writer was trying to send him<br />
to prison again!).<br />
<br />
Only Arya Veera Seenan lived long , old and weary and bitter about<br />
life and its cruelty. He denied he had anything to do with the<br />
murder.<br />
<br />
Jayanandam was charged with perjury and sentenced to a term in jail.<br />
He too committed suicide some years ago.<br />
<br />
Experts and even lay-men of those times feel that the truth about the<br />
murder did not come out, and Bhagavathar, N. S. Krishnan and others<br />
were poor victims of the British Indian Rulers, who used these<br />
ill-fated men as pawns in a game of power politics. Indeed one of <br />
the<br />
High Court judges who heard the remanded appeal remarked in open <br />
court<br />
that on the evidence even a rat could not be convicted.<br />
<br />
The real killers were never caught and the Truth lies buried<br />
somewhere, to this day. Truth will out, they say, and one like this<br />
writer wonders when! Perhaps, someday one day!<br />
