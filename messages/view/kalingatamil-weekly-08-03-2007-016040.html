  Invitation<br />
       <br />
  A woman came out of her house and saw 3 old men with long white<br />
beards sitting in her front yard. She did not recognize them. She said<br />
</blockquote><p>"I don't think I know you, but you must be hungry. Please come in and<br />
have something to eat."<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  "Is the man of the house home?", they asked. "No", she said. "He's<br />
out." "Then we cannot come in", they replied.<br />
     <br />
  In the evening when her husband came home, she told him what had<br />
happened. "Go tell them I am home and invite them in!" The woman went<br />
</blockquote><p>out and invited the men in. "We do not go into a House together," they<br />
replied. "Why is that?" she wanted to know.<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  One of the old men explained: "His name is Wealth," he said<br />
pointing to one of his friends, and said pointing to another one, "He<br />
</blockquote><p>is Success, and I am Love." Then he added, "Now go in and discuss with<br />
your husband which one of us you want in your home." <br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  The woman went in and told her husband what was said. Her husband<br />
was overjoyed. "How nice!!", he said. "Since that is the case, let us<br />
</blockquote><p>invite Wealth. Let him come and fill our home with wealth!"<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  His wife disagreed. "My dear, why don't we invite Success?" Their<br />
daughter-in-law was listening from the other corner of the house. She<br />
</blockquote><p>jumped in with her own suggestion: "Would it not be better to invite<br />
Love? Our home will then be filled with love!"<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  "Let us heed our daughter-in-law's advice," said the husband to<br />
his wife. "Go out and invite Love to be our guest." <br />
     <br />
  The woman went out and asked the 3 old men, "Which one of you is<br />
Love? Please come in and be our guest." <br />
     <br />
  Love got up and started walking toward the house. The other 2 also<br />
got up and followed him. Surprised, the lady asked Wealth and Success:<br />
</blockquote><p>"I only invited Love, Why are you coming in?"<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  The old men replied together: "If you had invited Wealth or<br />
Success, the other two of us would've stayed out, but since you<br />
</blockquote><p>invited Love, Wherever He goes, we go with him. Wherever there is<br />
Love, there is also Wealth and Success!!!!!!" <br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  OUR WISH FOR YOU... <br />
     <br />
  Where there is pain, we wish you peace and mercy. <br />
  Where there is self-doubting, we wish you a renewed confidence in<br />
your ability to work through them. <br />
  Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, we wish you<br />
understanding, patience, and renewed strength. <br />
  Where there is fear, we wish you love, and courage. Peace to you<br />

  commercial activities of some of the ports along the Orissan coast .<br />
     <br />
  The ports along the coast of Bay of Bengal had played important<br />
role in trade and commerce in coastal and oceanic trade from ancient<br />
</blockquote><p>times. This article would discuss commercial activities of some of the<br />
ports along the Orissan coast in medieval period. <br />
</p><blockquote>  The post-fifteenth century Orissa was not a period of urban decay<br />
as has been traditionally projected. The account of foreign<br />
</blockquote><p>travellers, factory records, Persian chronicles and indigenous<br />
literature present a different scenario. <br />
</p><blockquote>  Pipli, Hariharpur, Balasore and Harishpur rose into prominence.<br />
The unique character of the ports was due to commercial exchange and<br />
</blockquote><p>in this way urban centres developed due to happenings in the high<br />
seas. There was also vertical linkage with rural hinterland and<br />
horizontal linkage with different urban centres. Afterwards, the<br />
changing situation in the Indian Ocean around second half of<br />
eighteenth century resulted in decline in commercial traffic from the<br />
ports of Orissa.<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  Studying urban process and economy in their spatial<br />
and temporal diversity along with its historical context has been an<br />
</blockquote><p>unbeatable track among scholars of Indian history until recently. Its<br />
study in Orissa, whether eastern or western is virtually non-existent.<br />
The towns developed in whole of Orissa as centres of administration,<br />
pilgrimage and trade. It would be studied in a theoretical context<br />
taking into account development in the high seas, linkage with rural<br />
hinterland, commercial exchange and urban decay.<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  The towns developed in early medieval Orissa as centres of<br />
administration, pilgrimage and trade. Compared to the early period<br />
</blockquote><p>spanning from third century BCE to fifth century CE, the subsequent<br />
period witnessed proliferation of urban centres. <br />
</p><blockquote>  In the absence of sufficient data, it is difficult to ascertain<br />
whether the political centers were also place of trade and commerce. <br />
</blockquote><p>The use of suffix like pura, nagari and pattana with administrative<br />
centres like Dantapura, Kalinganagari, Simhapur, Suvarnapura etc<br />
proves that these were urban centres. Places of pilgrimage like<br />
Sriksetra Puri, Arkatirtha Konark and Ekamratirtha Bhubaneswar were<br />
not only religious centres but also functioned in economic milieu of<br />
the period. The temples became instrumental for the growth of market<br />
around them and pilgrims became consumers of the market. Possessing a<br />
long coastline, Orissa had number of seaports through which it<br />
established commercial and cultural intercourse with outside world. <br />
Places like Pithunda, Palura, Kalingapatnam, Manikapatna,<br />
Khalkattapatna, Konark etc became famous in international map. Some<br />
of these urban centres retained their importance in late medieval<br />
period and new towns came up. Therefore, it would<br />
</p><blockquote>  be travesty of truth in mentioning that there was urban decay in<br />
the so-called Muslim rule.<br />
  Abhinava Varanasi Kataka was the nerve centre of political and<br />
economic activities under the imperial Gangas and Gajapatis. It was a<br />
</blockquote><p>populous town in the medieval period. According to the land grant<br />
of1230 AD by Anangabhima III, the occupational group inhabiting the<br />
township covering thirty vati (375 acres) were perfumer (gandhika),<br />
dealer in conch shell (sankhika), goldsmith (suvarnkara), brazier<br />
(kamsakara), seller of betel leaf (tambulika), maker of jaggery<br />
(gudika), weaver (tanturvaya), fisherman (kaivarta) etc[i]. It was<br />
the capital of Orissa under the Mughals and was designated as Katak<br />
Banaras in the mahal-list of Ain-i-Akbari[ii]. The fort of Barabati<br />
was situated on the bifurcation of the rivers Mahanadi and Kathjori.<br />
Thomas Bowrey had described it as a city having nice buildings and<br />
broad streets[iii]. A mint was set up in Cuttack, from where gold,<br />
silver and copper coins were produced. Its silver filigree work was in<br />
great demand. The city also was famous<br />
</p><blockquote>  for corn, fine cloth, oil and butter[iv]. It had big bazaar for<br />
different commodities and names like Muhammadia bazaar are present.<br />
  The recently excavated port of Manikpatna, located on the bank of<br />
water-channel connecting Chilka lake with Bay of Bengal had yielded<br />
</blockquote><p>Neolithic celts, two sherds of Indian roulette ware, fragments of<br />
amphora, sherd with Kharoshti inscriptions and Puri-Kusana coins all<br />
pointers to Orissa's contact with outside world[v]. Deposits from<br />
period II (dated between twelfth century to early part of nineteenth<br />
century AD) consist of Chinese copper coins and Celadon ware, coins of<br />
Sahasmalla and brown glazed ware. The last item known as Maratuan<br />
ware named after a place in Myanmar was proof of trade link with that<br />
country. The Dutch in 1621 and English in 1631 attempted to establish<br />
trading settlement in Manikpatna. It was a great mart of salt in<br />
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Ganjam was another urban centre<br />
known for cotton cloth, beeswax, sugar cane and food grains. Its<br />
river was navigable from September to beginning of November. Puri,<br />
Konark, Banpur and Patnagarh<br />
</p><blockquote>  retained their importance as urban centres in late medieval period.<br />
Situated by the side of Calcutta-Ganjam road, places like Bhadrak,<br />
</blockquote><p>Jaleswar, Ramachandrapura, Remuna and Soro had some importance as<br />
these were halting stations for armies and travellers.<br />
</p><blockquote>  Sambalpur, which literally mean the town of wealth rose into<br />
prominence in medieval time after it became the capital of the Chauhan<br />
</blockquote><p>King Balaramdev in 1570 AD. Before that, the region was famous for<br />
diamonds as early as sixth century. Sambalpur, the capital of Chauhans<br />
of western Orissa was a diamond-producing centre[vi]. The presiding<br />
deity Samaleswari was installed in the centre of the fort of Sambalpur<br />
and innumerable diamond were present in her feet. A thriving diamond<br />
trade was there as evident form the accounts of T. Mootte in 1799.<br />
Sambalpur became the centre of political, commercial and military<br />
activities with the expansion of Chauhan kingdom. In the middle of<br />
seventeenth century, towns like Patnagarh, Barapali, Baudh, Sonepur,<br />
Khariar, Gangpur, Bonai etc had already developed an intricate<br />
political and trade network with Sambalpur. These towns also had<br />
themselves become urban centres. <br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  Suvarnapur (modern Sonepur) was not only an important capital city<br />
in medieval western Orissa, but also was an important centre for<br />
</blockquote><p>export trade through river. From: the neighbouring rural hinterland as<br />
well as urban centres like Baudh and Patna, different commodities were<br />
brought to Suvarnapur for export. It was also famous for manufacturing<br />
tusser cloth of excellent quality[vii]. The weaving was done by a<br />
professional class know as Bhuliya in local parlance. Brass and bell<br />
metals utensils were manufactured in this important urban centre.<br />
Temples and places of pilgrimage proliferated in medieval period and<br />
small township grew around temples of Ranipur-Jharial and Harishankar,<br />
Narashinghnath etc.<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  On the banks of river Mahanadi, there were urban centres like<br />
Sambalpur, Baudh, Binka, Sonepur etc. Intra-regional trade was carried<br />
</blockquote><p>out bringing about remarkable changes in the social and economic life<br />
of people. The urban centres of western Orissa were connected with<br />
eastern Chhatisgarh region and eastern Orissa through the Mahanadi<br />
facilitating intra-regional trade in commodities like: cotton, ivory,<br />
precious stones, paddy, cereal, salt and medicinal herbs. The volume<br />
of river borne trade began to decline only after coming of the<br />
railways. A large number of shrines of Gods and Goddesses were<br />
constructed catering to the religious needs of the people. There was<br />
never an urban decay in western Orissa as a whole. It was beyond doubt<br />
in western Orissa, there were different types of urban centres having<br />
functional differences.<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  In seventeenth century, the political boundary of southern and<br />
eastern Orissa was subjected to changes and parts of it were<br />
</blockquote><p>controlled by neighbouring states. The area from Puri to Hijli coast<br />
was treated as part of Bengal. In the south, the Gingelly coast i.e.,<br />
region between Ganjam up to river Godavari was regarded as part of<br />
Coromandel region. After coming of the Mughals, the southern ports of<br />
Orissa like Ganjam, Vizagpatnam and Bimlipatam declined to some<br />
extent. Probably the Mughal subadars and administrators showed<br />
indifference to the ports away from headquarters. Orissa was included<br />
in the suba of Bengal until 1607 and Mughal rulers with their<br />
headquarters in Bengal were interested in northern ports. Moreover,<br />
the southernmost sarkar of Kalinga dandapat and Rajahmundry did not<br />
come under effective control of the Mughals. After the conquest of<br />
Golconda by Aurangzeb in 1687, the southern part of Orissa was<br />
amalgamated with administrative unit of south. The<br />
</p><blockquote>  usual boundary of Orissa in different period of history along with<br />
vital part of coastal area was lost. Lack of royal patronage seemed<br />
</blockquote><p>to be another cause for decline of port-towns of southern Orissa. <br />
After the disintegration of Bahamani kingdom, the ruling elite was<br />
busy in carving out independent states. It became easier for the<br />
Portuguese to make their presence felt. The decline of southern ports<br />
of Orissa resulted in shifting of commercial activity to northern<br />
region. Trading centres were established by the European powers and<br />
consequently urban centres like Pipli, Balasore, Harishpur and<br />
Hariharpur rose into prominence.<br />
</p><blockquote>  As the urban centres developed due to growth of trade and<br />
commerce, the appropriate term should be port-town for these places. <br />
</blockquote><p>Situated on the mouth of Suvarnarekha river, Pipli became the earliest<br />
European settlement on the Orissan coast. The Portuguese established<br />
a trading centre in 1514, as there was free approach from sea. The<br />
British and the Dutch had established trading settlements in 1634 and<br />
1637 respectively. Hinterland of Pipli had cotton-producing centres<br />
like Mohanpur, Olmara and Jaleswar. The Asian merchants visited it<br />
to purchase different kinds of merchandise[viii] . A centre for<br />
shipbuilding, the importance of Pipli dwindled after silting of the<br />
river Suvarnarekha.<br />
</p><blockquote>  Hariharpur was the first factory that English established in 1633.<br />
Situated at the mouth of river Patua, it was a populous place and<br />
</blockquote><p>three thousand weavers were present[ix]. Different varieties of cloth<br />
were produced in Hariharpur. The cotton stuff like khasa and sahan<br />
were being exported from there. The town also had trading network for<br />
sale of goods brought by he merchants. In 1642, the factory was withdrawn.<br />
</p><blockquote>  Harishpur, another urban centre had been described by Thomas<br />
Bowrey as the only sea-port of Orissa and Sebastien Manrique visiting<br />
</blockquote><p>the place in 1640 termed it as a city. It was famous for cotton<br />
cloth, rice and shipbuilding. Majority of the urban centres developed<br />
due to textile manufacture, which was one of principal industries of<br />
medieval Orissa. The Ain-i-Akbari had attested to this fact [x].<br />
</p><blockquote>  Situated on the right bank of the river Budhabalanga, Balasore is<br />
on 21°30'12" north latitude and 86°58'16" east longitude. It is<br />
</blockquote><p>located about 15 kilometres from seashore. The Persian spelling<br />
Balesar is more akin to Oriya terminology Baleswar. It rose into<br />
prominence at the time of the Mughals becoming one of the major ports<br />
of Indian Ocean. Occupying a central position, it was well connected<br />
with centres of textile production like Mohanpur, Olmara, Dantan,<br />
Jaleswar, Kasiari and Mayurbhanj. The hinterland of Balasore had<br />
abundance of rice, pulse, tobacco, tasar, beeswax, iron and timber. <br />
It had good means of transport, as it was located on the main trade<br />
route between Puri and Hugli, which ultimately led to Delhi, via<br />
Qasimbazar, Patna, Varanasi and Lucknow[xi]. . The increase of price<br />
of staple commodities due to great famine of Gujrat in 1630-32 and<br />
scarcity of piece goods in Masulipatam compelled the English to move<br />
from Coromandel up the Bay of Bengal . The<br />
</p><blockquote>  English endeavour to have direct commercial enterprise in Orissan<br />
coast was successful and the Mughal subadar Mutaqad Khan granted them<br />
</blockquote><p>a parwana on 9 May 1633 to build factories, repair ships and trade<br />
free of customs. Ralph Cartwright, the English merchant set up a<br />
factory at Balasore on 16 June 1633 at the invitation of<br />
officer-in-charge of the district, Mir Qasim[xii]. Apart from the<br />
trade carried out by European factors, a brisk commercial enterprise<br />
went on by the free merchants and interlopers.<br />
</p><blockquote>  Though the Europeans played an important role in the trade of<br />
seventeenth century, the Asian merchants had engrossed a major share.<br />
</blockquote><p>The oceanic and coastal trade went unabated. The seaborn trade from<br />
the ports of Hugli and Balasore by Asian merchants continued with<br />
Southeast Asia. The Mughal aristocracy participated actively in trade<br />
from 1640s. They invested in shipbuilding. Starting from subadar and<br />
dewan to shiqdar and faujdar, the Mughal officials became involved in<br />
trade and commerce. The shahbandar (harbour master) of Balasore,<br />
nawab Nasib Khan was owner of a ship that was engaged in trade with<br />
Maldives. There was wide distribution of merchants having diverse<br />
ethnic and linguistic origins. They were brokers of the Europeans<br />
companies and traders with their own independent capital. Khemchand<br />
and Chintaman Shah were two prominent and influential merchants of<br />
Balasore dominating the commercial scene in the second half of<br />
seventeenth century[xiii]. Suraj Shah,<br />
</p><blockquote>  Hira Shah, Kalyan Rai, Rajaram, Ram Narayan, Gangaram and Gopal<br />
were some of the important traders of Balasore. Some of the Rajas of<br />
</blockquote><p>Orissa were owners of ship. The Raja of Kanika had a ship going to<br />
Coromandel coast and Sri Lanka for trade. There were also Muslim<br />
merchants in Balasore, who did not belong to the ruling class. The<br />
English Factory Records mention about these traders, who sold goods to<br />
the English on contract basis[xiv] . An Armenian merchant Khwaja<br />
Jaffar had settled at in Balasore.<br />
</p><blockquote>  The carrying of extensive trade by merchants of Balasore must have<br />
made the town prosperous as well as populous. The business<br />
</blockquote><p>transactions carried out concerning textile industry witnessed influx<br />
of different class of people. Method of procurement of textiles was<br />
similar to other parts of India[xv]. There was advance payment system<br />
known as dadni. After receiving advance, the intermediaries on<br />
paikars gave the amount to the weavers. The broker or dalal was link<br />
between the intermediary and merchant. Sometimes, the rich investors<br />
operated through agent or gumasta. The Dutch had salaried brokers and<br />
the English were paying brokerage charge or dasturi to the dalal . <br />
There was no direct link between the weavers and European factors. <br />
The condition of weavers was far from satisfactory, as they were<br />
indebted to the intermediaries. Hamlets of weavers and artisans<br />
developed around English factory. Balasore became new habitat for<br />
this migrant class from surrounding areas. <br />
</p><blockquote>  They did not have any control over the sell of the product.<br />
  Balasore and its hinterland were centre of manufacture and<br />
production of different commodities. Orissa was producing both<br />
</blockquote><p>agricultural and non-agricultural goods in excess, so the surplus was<br />
exported to different parts of India and abroad. Balasore was linked<br />
vertically with the surrounding areas serving as a market for surplus<br />
production. There was also horizontal linkage with different urban<br />
centres, which supplied varieties of commodities to the port-town. <br />
Balasore was the emporium of cotton yarn. The variety of piece-goods<br />
manufactured in the surrounding regions were sahan (sannoe, plain<br />
cotton good of ordinary quality), khasa (cossae, muslin of high<br />
quality), nillae(cotton and silk mixed, generally of blue colour),<br />
gingham (cotton mixed with tasar silk), doriya (striped muslin),<br />
herba (tasar silk) and calico (white cloth of thick yarn). <br />
Bleaching and dyeing of fabric was also done in Balasore.<br />
</p><blockquote>  In seventeenth century, rice was being cultivated in Balasore<br />
district and its export to coastal India and neighbouring countries<br />
</blockquote><p>continued until the second half of nineteenth century. Alexander<br />
Hamilton had referred to production of pulses and tobacco in<br />
Balasore[xvi]. Beeswax, items made of stone, wheat, ghee and sesamum<br />
oil were other products of Balasore. It was having a flourishing<br />
liquor industry. Punch houses were prevalent in 1670s. Saltpetre, an<br />
important ingredient for manufacture of gunpowder was being imported<br />
from Patna through land-route passing Qasimbazar and Hugli. Sugar was<br />
being produced in Udaiganj, Chandrakona, Goghat (presently in West<br />
Bengal) and Ganjam. It was being brought to Balasore for export by<br />
the English and Dutch companies. The English factors reported in 1650<br />
that price of sugar in Balasore was 7.5 to 8 rupees per bale and it<br />
increased in monsoon season to 11 to12 rupees[xvii]. <br />
</p><blockquote>  Shipbuilding was an important and developed industry in Balasore.<br />
Economically it was a major sector of urban employment for craftsmen,<br />
</blockquote><p>blacksmiths and artisans. The Mughal nobility had invested in this<br />
industry in 1640s. Need for naval defence and checking of Arkanese<br />
piracy compelled the Mughal government to construct a shipbuilding<br />
centre in Balasore. Availability of timber and iron from nearby<br />
Nilgiri Hill facilitated the task. The Mughal subadar of Bengal,<br />
Shaista Khan ordered naval construction in Balasore, Hugli and Jassore<br />
[xviii]. Craftsmen and blacksmiths went to Balasore from Harishpur<br />
port by the order of Sayid Muhammed, the Subadar of Orissa. Balasore<br />
had also facilities for repair work as evident from repair of English<br />
ships named Coaster and Endeavour[xix].<br />
</p><blockquote>  Balasore was visited by ships from Maldives, Sri Lanka, Indonesia<br />
(Aceh), Malaysia (Kedah) and Myanmar (Pegu, Arakan and Tennasserim). <br />
</blockquote><p>The merchants of Balasore had extensive coastal trade with ports of<br />
Coromandel coast, Calcutta and Dhaka and occasionally with Malabar and<br />
Gujrat. Cowrie was being imported from Maldives and Cochin China<br />
(southern Vietnam). Bullion was a feature of import trade of Orissa by<br />
the English. The import of silver from Japan was stopped due to low<br />
exchange rate and from 1680s, the English imported it from Europe. <br />
The Dutch and English were importing lead. Import of elephants to the<br />
port-town of Balasore was a regular phenomenon. These were used in<br />
religious processions and in the army as a means of transport. <br />
Zamindars, rajas and nawabs purchased the elephants. Two ships<br />
belonging to the king of Thailand brought elephants from Tennasserim<br />
in 1679[xx]. The commodities that were being imported to Balasore<br />
were precious metals, vermilion<br />
</p><blockquote>  quicksilver, European guns, tin, copper, nutmeg, cinnamon, pepper<br />
and cloves. Items of export were piece goods, rice, wheat, pulses,<br />
</blockquote><p>ghee, oil, and sugar and gingelly seed. Commercial importance of<br />
Balasore town could be attested from the fact that number of ships<br />
recorded for Balasore was in preponderance[xxi].<br />
</p><blockquote>  In the eighteenth century documents, Balasore is not mentioned<br />
frequently unlike Qasimbazar, Calcutta, Dhaka and Patna. The muslins<br />
</blockquote><p>of Bengal received a bigger market in England than the piece goods of<br />
Balasore. A major settlement on the bank of river Hugli was necessary<br />
due to easier communication with inland factories of Bengal. The<br />
Court of Committee passed orders for transfer of headquarters on the<br />
Bay from Balasore to Hugli, which was retained as chief settlement of<br />
Bengal by Stryensham Master in 1675[xxii]. Importance of Calcutta<br />
grew up after acquirement of Zamindari right from nawab in 1698 and<br />
Balasore only looked into the requirement of ships calling there<br />
before going to Bay of Bengal. The channel to the sea was silted up<br />
and the mouth of river Budhabalanga became unsuitable for ships. <br />
Distance between seashore and town increased by five kilometres. <br />
Beginning from last decade of seventeenth century, the Mughal<br />
aristocracy began to withdraw from<br />
</p><blockquote>  investment in shipping. The frequent change of naib nazims of<br />
Orissa and local officials posed hindrance to trade as earlier<br />
</blockquote><p>privileges given to the English factors were interfered and new<br />
demands were put forth. The repeated Maratha invasions from 1740s<br />
onwards disrupted the hinterland of Balasore.<br />
</p><blockquote>  Though commercial activity declined in Balasore, it was not<br />
completely abandoned. In the first few decades of eighteenth century,<br />
</blockquote><p>it was exporting foodstuffs and coarser textiles. From: Maldives it<br />
was importing cowry and in turn exporting rice. Iron, stone ware and<br />
rice was being supplied to Calcutta in mid-eighteenth century. The<br />
two Gingelly ports of Ganjam and Vizagpatam ferried grain to deficit<br />
areas in the coast. Salt export to Bengal and Berar continued.<br />
Contillo, Pipli, Soro, Bhadrak, Harishpur and Manikpatna functioned as<br />
small towns. Cuttack retained some of its earlier importance. <br />
However, all those activities were in a much-reduced scale. There was<br />
general decline of Orissa's oceanic and coastal trade in eighteenth<br />
century. Consequently, the urban centres of seventeenth century<br />
gradually lost their significance.<br />
</p><blockquote>     <br />
  There is no doubt that wealth in urban areas was derived from<br />
rural surplus. But the unique character of towns was due to<br />
</blockquote><p>commercial exchange and in this way, urbanization was result of<br />
developments happening on the seas. In case of the port-town of<br />
Balasore and other urban centres similar thing happened. Towards the<br />
second half of eighteenth century, rise of Calcutta fleet affected<br />
fortunes of Balasore. The European companies and traders had made<br />
inroads into the preserves of Indian merchants. Hinterland of port<br />
towns became accessible to the English. Orissa responded to the<br />
changing situation of Indian Ocean and there was decline of commercial<br />
traffic from Balasore across the Bay of Bengal. Political<br />
dismemberment of the state under colonial rule and the British<br />
economic policy in Orissa sounded the final death-knell. Afterwards,<br />
the colonial towns like Cuttack, Balasore, Sambalpur, Ganjam etc<br />
responded in a different way to the changing pace. The administrative<br />
</p><blockquote>  measures of the colonial government resulted in change of social<br />
structure, mobility in occupation, decline in indigenous craft etc.<br />
</blockquote><p>There were major changes in economy and society of colonial Orissa in<br />
the context of colonial policy.<br />
