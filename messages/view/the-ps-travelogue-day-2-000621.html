    <p>Dear all...<br />
<br />
Day 2 (Saturday, February 8th):<br />
<br />
Day 2 started in a more leisurely way than Day 1- we started at 7.30,<br />
finished breakfast, and set off on our way to the Periya Koil, the first on<br />
our agenda.<br />
<br />
The Periya Koil, as many people have talked about in many different ways, is<br />
a masterpiece. Built by the hero of our story, its size, structure, its<br />
dazzling dimensions have earned it a place in World Heritage. What more can<br />
one say?<br />
<br />
In side the temple complex, we split up. Half of us went wandering around<br />
the enormous corridors that surround the temple, some of us ambled over to<br />
the Nandi. Mr.Vishwaksenan disappeared to hunt out the Kalki agent for that<br />
area, and they appeared in a few minutes, right in the middle of a<br />
discussion about the temple.<br />
<br />
Mr. Balakumaran had said in his tape that the so-called 'single stone' at<br />
the head of the vimanam wasn't a single stone at all, but was made of many<br />
stones set very close together ("...aaranju chulai maathiri...")- and with<br />
luck, the temple authorities agreed to open up the first level of the<br />
temple- a part which is generally closed to the public, and which requires<br />
special admission if one has to see it. All of us trooped up the stone steps<br />
up to the first level. They led upto a terrace, with the gopuram rising to<br />
our left. The Kalki agent led us to the doorway and unlocked it.<br />
<br />
We stepped inside a dark corridor, which ran to our left and right, and<br />
vanished into darkness. Another set of steps led to a doorway which looked<br />
onto a chamber over the garba griham. It was barred at one end (because we<br />
mustn?t stand right on top of the garba griham)- and then the spotlights<br />
were switched on. We raised our heads and looked straight up to the top of<br />
the gopuram. The hollow structure spiralled into the darkness right up to<br />
the very top. It was a magnificent architectural feat. How they ever managed<br />
to do this so many thousands of years ago is simply amazing...<br />
<br />
<br />
Outside, the dark corridor was lit up, and we could see sculptures detailing<br />
the various dance poses of Lord Nataraja. The panel above the sculptures was<br />
filled with vague colours and outlines. These, we learnt, were paintings<br />
showing King Raja raja and his consorts, and other scenes. Almost nothing<br />
remained of them. The dance poses, on the other hand, were minute- each one<br />
of them was exquisitely detailed. (Dancer Padma Subramanian once visited<br />
this place, it seems, and did some serious research for a whole fortnight).<br />
<br />
Some of the dance poses weren't completed- blocks of stone, chiselled and<br />
ready for sculpting, had been left empty- they seemed to waiting for the<br />
hands of a great sculptor to touch them, who would shake them out of their<br />
sleep and convert them into gleaming figurines...<br />
<br />
This chamber containing the dance panels, with its dark corridor running<br />
'inside' the gopuram is quite an architectural feat in itself. Its walls,<br />
rising upwards, broaden gradually to meet the outer gopuram at the top.<br />
Magnificent.<br />
<br />
After another bout of photographs, we descended to the ground (literally and<br />
imaginatively:-), and began a walking tour of the corridors that surround<br />
the temple. The paintings on the walls had been disfigured (by 'English'<br />
kalvettus, as someone quipped)- but for all that, their beauty was not<br />
impaired. One could only marvel at the vision of Raja raja- not just his<br />
ambition to produce one of the greatest temples in South India, but his<br />
magnanimity in acknowledging the fact that other people (his wives, and<br />
those who had contributed wealth and effort in building the temple) had put<br />
in valuable effort in completing the temple.<br />
<br />
"...Shri Raajaraajeeswara mudaiyaarkku naan kuduthanavum akkan kudduthanavum<br />
nam pendugal kuduthanavum matrum kuduthaar kuduthanavum..."<br />
<br />
After all, he could just have said that he built the temple, and left it at<br />
that. Who would have dared to oppose him?<br />
<br />
(Seems he was taking a bath in the Chozha Maligai in Thanjai, when he<br />
ordered etching inscriptions into stone:-)<br />
<br />
After visiting the other sannithis and lounging about the lawns for a while,<br />
we left the temple reluctantly. It was 11 AM when we started towards<br />
Saraswathi Mahal (Periya Koil had made us stay an hour more than we<br />
intended:-). Since we wanted to make good time to Kodikarai, we stayed in<br />
Saraswathi Mahal just long enough to take a sweeping look at it- not more<br />
than half an hour. (what we looked through included the Maratha dresses,<br />
weapons, kitchen utensils and other odds and ends. I especially liked the<br />
'thengai thuruvi':-)<br />
<br />
One of the guardian angels of Thanjavur, the 'Nisumba Sudhani' (described by<br />
Balakumaran in his tape as quite a hideous entity) was on our agenda- the<br />
temple still exists, but is known as the 'Vada Badhra kaali (info- Mr.<br />
Sunder Bharadwaj) temple. Since it was nearing twelve, we decided to skip<br />
it. Lunch was finished quickly in Thanjai, and we set off at 1.30 PM - to<br />
Point Calimere.<br />
<br />
<br />
We reached Kodaikarai by 5 PM ( around 100 Kms). The roads were not too bad,<br />
we made good time, really (Passing the 'Raamar Paadham' on the way, and<br />
uppalams, signaling the approach of the sea). Our first stop, naturally, was<br />
the Kuzhagar Koil. A big, graceful structure with graying walls loomed up in<br />
front of us with a high mathil suvar. Kodikarai proper was 4 kms from the<br />
Koil. (Apparently, Poonghuzhali jumped down from the mathil and sprinted all<br />
the 4kms to the beach. Quite in keeping with her character!)<br />
<br />
We took a tour of the temple, which stood majestically, with a few huts at<br />
the side. Thankfully, this was not quite so dilapidated as some<br />
others(probably due to the thiruppani that seems to have been done- in<br />
1940s). There were some obvious additions- the brick-paved floor, for<br />
example. The sculptures surrounding the sannithi were in good condition too.<br />
And this is where we took the photo of the combination lock (which<br />
Krupashankar has posted in his website<br />
(</p><br /><p><a target="_blank" href="/redirect.php?uri=http://www.geocities.com/shankarkrupa/psmy/poottu.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/...rkrupa/psmy/poottu.jpg</a></p><p>)- the one where the<br />
archagar is holding it like an <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>47:-). (There is a reference to this lock<br />
in this week's Kalki issue too- dated 16.02.2003 under the section 'Remote'.<br />
Apparently, it was mentioned in the 'Kalach chuvadu' section in Jaya TV.)<br />
<br />
Kamal decided to show off his driving abilities by rushing the van at us:-)-<br />
and we took some photos here too. The approach road to the temple is<br />
well-paved and the whole area is neat and tidy (in spite of scrubby bushes<br />
abounding all over the place)-obviously, it has been re-furbished since<br />
Kalki's times. Kuzhagar is no longer all that alone.<br />
<br />
At 5.30 PM, we started towards the beach- and it proved to be the best<br />
evening in the trip:-)<br />
<br />
We stopped at the forest department's place first- we needed special<br />
permission to get to the beach. After suitably arranging matters, we took<br />
off. (The beach brought on talk about the trip to Sri Lanka). The road ran<br />
through the village and entered scrubland. After a while we came to a gate,<br />
after passing which, we entered the real Kodikarai- described by Kalki.<br />
Thorny shrubs grew in clumps all over the vast, flatland, stretching away<br />
into the horizon. Deer, grazing patiently, threw startled glances at our<br />
approach, and gambolled into the shrubbery (just as Poonghuzhali saw them).<br />
Some of them suddenly jumped high in the air- we wondered if there were any<br />
'puthai kuzhis' there. The gound seemed firm in most places, and slightly<br />
muddled in others.<br />
<br />
<br />
The mud road meandered through more shrubs, some growing so thickly that<br />
there were a few possible sites for the 'maraindha mandapam' <img src='/img/common/smileys/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='smiley' /> , twisting<br />
and turning. A few cows strayed about lazily. Finally, a few minutes later,<br />
the sea appeared- little waves flowing gently to the shore, and the blue<br />
waters fading into the horizon- exactly as in 'Ponniyin Selvan'.<br />
<br />
One could easily picture Vandhiyathevan trying to wash himself in the sea,<br />
desperate to get himself clean:-). There was a lonely brick structure right<br />
on the beach- the remains of some long gone lighthouse of some bygone era,<br />
perhaps. There was a curious hole in it- probably a window embrasure, and we<br />
all took turns, sticking our heads through it.:-)<br />
<br />
The setting sun threw its slanting rays through the 'window', and the sea<br />
shore was converted into an idyllic spot, stretching away on all sides. It<br />
was completely empty-except for us. Our first instinct was to get into the<br />
sea, which we did. Krupashankar and Kamal emulated a Veera Saivan and<br />
Vaishnavan-both had their hands on the other's neck- and the former promptly<br />
sat down in the water (which was splendidly cool after the hot drive).<br />
<br />
We spent an hour there. splashing through the water to our heart's content.<br />
Almost everyone, I think, pictured Poonghuzhali and her Kolli-vai pisaasus<br />
there:-)- and indulged in a frantic photo-session. God knew what<br />
Krupashankar was trying to do in the sea- we suddenly heard agonized yells<br />
and looked back to see him scrabbling wildly after his slippers, which had<br />
floated away on the waves:-).<br />
<br />
It was a delightful hour. The waves glinted in the last rays of the sun, and<br />
the marshland glowed in an unearthly light. Shadows fell everywhere,<br />
suddenly transforming the sea-shore into another world- one full of strange<br />
and beautiful entities. I for one fully expected Ravidasan to emerge out of<br />
the sand dunes,:-)<br />
<br />
And then, it was time to go. By 6.30 PM, a tired but exultant <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> crew<br />
marched to the van, full of sea-water, shells and loads of Kodikarai sand-<br />
only to be told sternly by our driver that he was not going to have his<br />
clean van soiled by us in all our sand and filth. "enga venaa ukkarunga,<br />
Mela venumnaa ukkarunga, anaa ulle gille vanthu asingam panneenga..."<br />
<br />
It was at that moment, I think, that we all went crazy.:-)<br />
<br />
[Later, we were all pretty sure that Poonghuzhali's 'aavi', floating around<br />
the beaches of Kodikarai in spirit form, must have entered us all as<br />
suitable to carry out her wishes- nothing else would explain what we<br />
did.:-)]<br />
<br />
One and all were hit by the same idea all at once. Kamal and Krupa darted<br />
towards the rear, followed by Sathya, me, Anuradha, Lavanya, Radhika and<br />
Viji- and before anyone knew what was happening, all of us had scrambled up<br />
the slim ladder to the top of the carrier! It was a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of a squeeze on top,<br />
of course, with so many people- but that added to the general delight. All<br />
the elders kept telling us that we were bound to fall off, that we'd have a<br />
tough time making it to the vilage in one piece- and all their words fell on<br />
deaf ears. We were determined on a 'crazy African Safari' (as Mr. Sharma put<br />
it), and nothing would stop us.<br />
<br />
The van driver gave up his eforts to get us down, and started his vehicle,<br />
which gave a lurch and nearly upset some of us.:-)<br />
<br />
And then started a weird and wonderful ride through the marshes of<br />
Kodikarai- twilight had set in, the view from the top rolled away before our<br />
eyes in all directions for miles, the sky was streaked with the blues and<br />
pinks of sunset- in a word, it was superb.<br />
<br />
The van went slowly, but there were the unavoidable humps and bumps in the<br />
road, sending us all into yells whenever they happened. Krupashankar<br />
proposed a contest to see who could stand up on the carrier, Lavanya was<br />
seized by a desire to sing 'Alai kadalum oynthirukka..." (which she did:-),<br />
and all of us were caught by the wonderful scenery. No deer were present,<br />
but we suddenly came upon a lone and solitary...wild black horse, gambolling<br />
in the flatlands! Of course, it must have been the horse ridden by the Oomai<br />
Rani:-).<br />
<br />
The original 'safari' was to have been until the gates of Kodikarai- but we<br />
voted to ride on until the village was reached.<br />
<br />
Sea-birds flew overheard, darkness was closing in, the lighthouse started<br />
flashing (the only 'kolli-vai pisaasu' we could see) and the sea-wind<br />
rippled across us. All around us, bushes and shrubs weaved along the road.<br />
Some one from inside the van yelled to ask if we were all there on the roof,<br />
and how many of us had been bumped off. The van obligingly gave another<br />
lurch and set everyone screeching. All the animals and spirits must have<br />
heard us for miles around:-)<br />
<br />
Telephone wires began appearing, the mark of civlization- and then came the<br />
agonizing question- we had climbed up easily enough, would climbing down be<br />
that easy (especially Anuradha, -"...naan nadakkum pothE thoppu thoppunnu<br />
vizhuven...":-)???<br />
<br />
But we managed it. (see Krupa's photos:-). All the elders promptly got off<br />
the van and stood around us, grinning and marking our 'progress' and<br />
commenting wildly on how we must get down, where we must place our feet and<br />
everything else. The locals gaped at this spectacular show.<br />
<br />
Finally, all our dust left on the carrier, we settled down in our wet<br />
clothes inside the van, playing 'Anthakshari' and generally fooling about.<br />
Night had fallen and Kodikarai was left behind. Kudanthai was the night<br />
halt, and when we reached it after three hours, and checked in Hotel<br />
Chela's, all of us were ready for our rest.<br />
<br />
(To be continued...)<br />
