        <p>Dear all...<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's what we did on Day 3...<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 3 (Sunday, February 9th):<br />
<br />
<br />
On this, the last day of the trip, things were made easy by the fact that we<br />
had stopped over at Kudanthai (instead of Thanjavur, as originally planned)-<br />
so all the places in our itinerary could be reached quickly. Our first stop,<br />
Thirupurambayam (the site of the conspiracy of the Pandiya aabathuthavis)<br />
was a mere 4kms from the city proper. We'd decided to skip breakfast, so we<br />
could have more time to spend on temples.<br />
<br />
The early morning <acronym title="All India Radio">AIR </acronym>was cool and we made good progress. As we neared<br />
Thirupurambayam, we could see thick clumps of bamboo dotting the landscape.<br />
Manniyaar appeared in a little while, with barely a trickle of water in it.<br />
For all that, the river bank looked quite attractive. What it must have<br />
looked like in full flow passes imagination:-). The temple at<br />
Thirupurambayam is quite huge, with a well-built mathil suvar, and<br />
well-defined sculptures. A single-tiered corridor led to one side of the<br />
temple and a narrow flight of steps went from the ground floor to the next<br />
level. The walls were filled with scribbling- but we found the view<br />
exciting. The architecture inside the gopuram, for one thing, was admirable-<br />
and it was similar to what we'd seen earlier at Thanjai- except that this<br />
was on a smaller scale. Lord Shiva rules as Saatchinaatha Perumaan here, and<br />
we spent an enjoyable half-hour here. From: there, it was Thiruvalanchuzi.<br />
<br />
By 10.30 AM, we had reached Thiruvalanchuzhi- which boasts of an elegant<br />
temple- and a ruined structure at a little distnace from it, with just one<br />
sannithi (collapsing within itself) which contains inscriptions that contain<br />
the names of Panchavan Maadhevi (Raja raja's fifth wife), and Maathevadigal<br />
(his daughter). We mulled over this for some time, it put forth new ideas.<br />
The whole place, which can be accessed through a gap in the compound wall of<br />
the main temple, is overgrown with shrubbery and trees- it looks like the<br />
site of an ancient Maya excavation. After some photos, we moved to the main<br />
temple. Krupashankar, Sathya and Lavanya went haring off towards a small<br />
room that was built in a corner of the complex- the whole path that led to<br />
the section was filled with thorns, and they ended up doing a hop, skip and<br />
jump dance on the ground (accompanied by grinning comments from those of us<br />
who stood outside:-). They had barely started staggering on their way back<br />
when someone assailed us with the speed of a whirlwind and welcomed us all<br />
heartily, with a booming voice.<br />
<br />
This was Mr. Sundar Bharadwaj(Mr. Balakumaran's friend), the expert who'd<br />
helped us draft our route map and is a veritable mine of infomation on<br />
Chozhas. He and his wife had come on an errand of their own, and had run<br />
into us (he'd hoped he would:-) (He was also the person I referred to right<br />
at the beginning, as the one who gave us the inba athirchi <img src='/img/common/smileys/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='smiley' /> <br />
<br />
Mr. Sundar Bharadwaj's (henceforth SB) enthusiasm quickly infected all of<br />
us. In one whirlwind tour, he explained to us about the beauty of the<br />
'kodungais' -curving stone edges that decorated the roof of the sannithis<br />
(the best are at Aavudaiyaar Koil- it seems that in those days they used to<br />
ask for kodungais sculpted like the ones in Aavudaiyaar Koil), the 'kal<br />
palagani' (the stone grill) for it is very intricately wrought and<br />
well-finished- and a small panel right on top of one of the doorways to the<br />
sannithi, which shows an interesting scene- SB said that it depicted Raja<br />
raja and Karuvoor Thevar sitting at the feet of Lord Shiva (which again,<br />
seemed to imply that Raja raja had died by the time this panel was<br />
finished).<br />
<br />
SB next showed the temple kulam- a figurine was etched there, with hands<br />
folded and inscriptions dotted the stones.(He gave us a good deal of<br />
information which caused a lot of discussion). We left at 11.30 AM, for the<br />
Panchavan Maathevi Pallipadai, built by Rajendra Chozhan in memory of his<br />
father's fifth wife. Less than a couple of kilometres from Thiruvalanchuzhi,<br />
this huge, imposing structure can be reached by a short walk through a small<br />
mud-track, As soon as you come into the clearing a ruined, half-fallen brown<br />
structure meets you, covered by vines and creepers.<br />
<br />
SB has really spent enormous time and energy over the Chozhas- listening to<br />
his words, we could actually go back to the era of the Chozhas, their lives,<br />
their trials, tribulations- one could actually feel the feet of the emperors<br />
who had walked about in this half-ruined pallipadai and paid their respects<br />
to this favoured queen of Raja raja.<br />
<br />
We could make out a few words among the inscriptions in the stone ,<br />
particularly the name of the queen- but that was about all. By this time,<br />
time was running out, so we bid a hasty good-bye and continued on our way.<br />
<br />
We stopped next at a vast field, with a banyan tree and others standing in a<br />
group at on end. This, said SB, was the site of the old Pazhaiyaarai<br />
aranmanai, once populated by the Chozha royalty. We could find a few<br />
'ottanchillus' if we burrowed around, he said. ("...intha idathukku<br />
vantheengannaa, inga yaaro irunthirukkaa, yaaro innum irakkaannu nannaa<br />
theriyum..."- Balakumaran). After a last lingering look at the empty field,<br />
the only relic of royalty, we were on our way next- to Patteeswaram.<br />
<br />
Patteeswaram, as most people know, is a place teeming with the local<br />
population. Its a well-known temple- and there, we learnt a great deal from<br />
the archagar who is a mine of information himself. The Durgaiyamman reigning<br />
as the deity was originally the guardian deity of the pazhaiyaarai palace,<br />
and the Shanmugar and Bhairava deities were there too. He explained to us a<br />
good deal about the hairstyles and dress-codes of the past- remarking how<br />
fashion repeats itself:-)<br />
<br />
We spent some time there, where SB gave us a HUGE garland of lemons (that<br />
he'd bought for worship) and an assortment of keychains (as mementos, he<br />
said:-). Our next stop was the Nandipura Vinnagaram. The temple's garba<br />
griham was not open (it was after 12 PM, when we went)- so we took a swift<br />
look at Lord Jagannaathar and went to the Paalkulathamman Koil.<br />
<br />
This temple has quite a history in itself. The temple itself stands by the<br />
road, painted in today's garish colours. On one's first approach to the<br />
temple, the pillar to the right holds great significance. This pillar, it<br />
seems, is the only remaining witness to have seen Raja raja Chozhan at his<br />
death- it was part of the mandapam in which the great emperor's body was<br />
laid. Due to some reason, the mandapam was demolished- and eventually,<br />
Rajendra Chozhan's thalapathi underwent a viratham, uprooted the pillar<br />
which was undamaged, and established it in the Paalkulathamman Koil. It<br />
still stands, painted a pinkish shade, a silent witness to a thousand years<br />
of history.<br />
<br />
By this time, it was noon, and a lunch was in order. SB escorted us to his<br />
favourite haunt, Maami's mess (Kudanthai), where we were served a delicious<br />
lunch in a homely atmosphere. After a brief rest at the hotel, we started<br />
again. Our next stop was Darasuram (here's how it came by its current name:<br />
originally called Rajarajeswaram- Rajarajapuram-Rarapuram-Darasuram).<br />
<br />
Words cannot describe the beauty of Darasuram. One will have to invent a<br />
whole new language to do justice to that beautiful temple. The huge<br />
dimensions of the temple, its corridors stretching away, the chariot-shaped<br />
structure pulled by exquisitely carved horses, its intricate panels,<br />
depicting the Meenakshi Kalyaanam in one, scenes from the Ramayana in the<br />
other, the five distinctly carved stone windows, each of a different design,<br />
a scene showing Sundarar pulling a devotee's son out of a crocodile, a<br />
match-box sized Pillaiyaar, steps which produce musical notes...the list is<br />
endless. A precisely carved 'Lingothpavar' decorates the back of the<br />
vimanam, and the distinctly carved Lord Shiva with three heads and eight<br />
hands is said to be found nowhere else in India.<br />
<br />
We were breathless when we left the main temple to visit the next one, the<br />
Amman Koil. This was slightly smaller, and rather less complicated, but it<br />
held its share of treasures, nevertheless. A few photos here, and we were<br />
off to Nachiyaar Koil. Famous for its Kal garudan, this temple ascends in a<br />
series of steps, until one sees the deity. By this time, we were beginning<br />
to be rushed for time, so we did a quick tour, and were soon on our way to<br />
Ammankudi.<br />
<br />
Ammankudi is supposedly the birthplace of Krishnan Raaman, the famed second<br />
in command of Rajendra Chozhan. The temple is nothing like the temples we'd<br />
seen earlier in the day- its been white-washed, painted, and now stands as a<br />
typically 'modern' temple- devoid of any special characteristics. We<br />
searched around for a sculpture of Raja raja- but couldn't find it.<br />
<br />
Last on our agenda, at 6.30 PM, we started for Konerirajapuram (originally<br />
called Thirunallam, this is where Vanathi first meets young Arulmozhi- he<br />
valiantly rescues a nest of birds by arriving on an elephant:-). This temple<br />
is built on fairly large dimensions, and we spent a considerable amount of<br />
time admiring the exquisite bronze of Lord Nataraja. Night had fallen by<br />
this time, and we made another quick tour of the temple. Chembiyan Maadevi<br />
was depicted on one of the panels, paying her respect to the deity. (These<br />
were in the dark, we couldn't have seen them if someone hadn't obliged us by<br />
handing us a light).<br />
<br />
By 8 PM, Thirunallam had been seen. We climbed into the bus, and started on<br />
our journey back home.We had A late dinner at 10 PM. The whole night was<br />
spent in sharing memories of what we'd seen, what we could see next- and<br />
many, many more things. At 3.45 AM the next morning, we'd reached the<br />
outskirts of Chennai. Everyone got off at their homes- and thus ended our<br />
momentous tour of Ponniyin Selvan's 'Kathaikkalam'.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Many things made our trip memorable- the fact that we were all bound by one<br />
excellent work, the fact that we shared the same wavelength, that we could<br />
discuss <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> without being obliged to explain what we were talking about every<br />
single line (for example, if you suddenly lapsed into SenThamizh, nobody<br />
would look at you as if you'd gone crazy:-). These were subtle things- not<br />
easily visible to a lay person- but so easily seen by people who share a<br />
love for Kalki and his magnum opus.<br />
<br />
Vaazhga Ponniyin Selvan....!! Valarga athan pugazh!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards...<br />
<br />
A very fortunate,<br />
Pavithra.<br />
