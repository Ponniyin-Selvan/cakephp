<br />
<br />
ONLY A handful of temples have been dedicated to Lord Varaha, the <br />
most important of them being those at Thiruvidaventhai <br />
(Thiruvidanthai), on way to Kadalmallai (Mahabalipuram) and <br />
Srimushnam, where the Lord is hailed as `Gnanapiran.' But one place, <br />
which bears the name of this incarnation is Swedha Varaha Kshethram <br />
or Thiruvellarai, 17 km from Tiruchi on the road to Thuraiyur, and <br />
it is one of the 108 holy places. But the Lord standing tall and <br />
facing east is known as Pundarikakshan or the `Lotus-eyed God.' This <br />
ancient temple has been renovated at a cost of Rs. 21.25 lakhs and <br />
the Mahasamprokshanam was performed on March 16. <br />
<br />
Considered to be anterior to Srirangam, it is also known as <br />
Swedhagiri, Adhivellarai, Uthama Kshethram and Hita Kshethram. <br />
According to the Puranas, 64 `Chathuryugas' (the present Kaliyuga <br />
being one among them) have passed since the Lord was enshrined here <br />
and the temple was built by Emperor Sibi. <br />
<br />
Bhoomidevi and Sage Markandeya were among those who worshipped the <br />
Lord here. Sibi brought 3,700 families of Srivaishnavite Brahmins <br />
from the banks of the Ganga and Yamuna and settled them here as per <br />
the advice of Sage Markandeya. When one of them passed away, the <br />
emperor was perturbed but the Lord told him that He would take the <br />
place of the 3,700th Brahmin. <br />
<br />
According to another legend, the emperor, before he built the <br />
temple, one day saw a white boar (Swedha Varaham) in the forest and <br />
chased it. It hid itself in an anthill near the place where Sage <br />
Markandeya was doing penance. When he enquired the sage about the <br />
boar he asked him to pour milk over the anthill to find it. <br />
<br />
He did so and found the massive idol of the Lord in its present form <br />
emerge from it. The Lord told the emperor to build a temple there. <br />
This was said to have happened millions of years ago. <br />
<br />
The Goddess in this holy place is known by the beautiful names of <br />
Pankaya Selvi and Shenbagavalli. According to legend She did penance <br />
here for union with the Lord, who appeared as Krishna from a well <br />
known as `Poonkinaru,' long before the Lord took the incarnation as <br />
Devaki's son in Mathura. That seems to be the reason for Saint <br />
Periyazhwar addressing the Lord here as child Krishna. Assuming the <br />
role of Yasodha, he appeals to the Lord to allow Him to apply <br />
`Kaappu' on Him. <br />
<br />
In ten poems, he portrays the childish pranks of Lord Krishna. But <br />
for Thirumangai Azhwar the Lord here is the one who took <br />
incarnations as Parasurama, Rama, Krishna, Narasimha, Varaha and <br />
Koorma. He also refers to the Lord taking the form of Hamsa and <br />
Parimuka Perumal (Hayagriva), which are not so well known. He has <br />
also sung the glory of the Lord in his `Siriya Thirumadal' and <br />
`Periya Thirumadal.' Both the saints have dedicated to the Lord 24 <br />
Pasurams. <br />
<br />
There are seven holy water sources in the temple known as Divya <br />
Theertham, Varaha Theertham, Kandha Pushkarani, Chandra Pushkarani, <br />
Padma, Pushkala and Manikarnika Theerthams. The temple, surrounded <br />
on all sides by 36-feet-high compound walls, has a 50-feet-high <br />
unfinished Rajagopuram at the entrance and resembles the Srirangam <br />
temple in many ways. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
The utsavar idols of Sri Senthamarai Kannan and Senkamalavalli <br />
Thayar. <br />
<br />
Situated on a sprawling 10-acre site the temple has three Prakarams. <br />
Lord Pundarikaksha in the sanctum sanctorum is in a standing posture <br />
facing east. There are shrines for Krishna, Vishwaksenar, <br />
Nammazhwar, Chakarathazhwar, Nadhamunigal, Kulasekara Azhwar, <br />
Thondarippodi Azhwar, Andal, Ramanuja and Manavala Mamunigal. <br />
<br />
Two entrances <br />
<br />
<br />
There are two entrances to the main shrine  one opened during the <br />
Utharayanam (Thai to Ani months) and the other opened during the <br />
Dakshinayanam (Aadi to Margazhi). The Vimanam is known as <br />
Vimalakrithi Vimanam. There is a separate shrine for Goddess Pankaya <br />
Selvi on the right side and She is the custodian of the entire <br />
temple town. The Jeeyar here is known as `Pankaya Selvi Jeeyar.' The <br />
temple is famous for its `Swasthik Kulam' (Naalu Mooali Kaeni) on <br />
the southeastern side. <br />
<br />
Ramanuja spent many years in this holy place. Vedanta Desika and <br />
Manavala Mamunigal also offered `Mangalasasanam' to Lord <br />
Pundarikaksha. Uyyakondar, a disciple of Nadhamunigal, was born <br />
here. <br />
<br />
When Nadhamunigal, an expert in `Ashtanga Yoga,' offered to impart <br />
training in the same to him, Uyyakondar was said to have politely <br />
turned down the offer saying that `how can one celebrate a marriage <br />
in a house where death has occurred.' <br />
<br />
The inference thereby was that when there were thousands of souls to <br />
be redeemed, there was no point in his learning the Yoga to attain <br />
eternal bliss. <br />
<br />
He was said to have taught the people Azhwars' Divya Prabandam <br />
songs, which were brought back from the oblivion by his mentor. <br />
Another preceptor, Engalazhwan, who was an expert in Sri Bashyam, <br />
was born here. <br />
<br />
The Pallava Kings have carved out two cave temples in the rocks in <br />
this place, and there are many inscriptions throwing light on the <br />
history of the Cholas and Pallavas. Historians consider one of them <br />
to belong to the period of `Pallava Malla' Nandivarman II and <br />
another belongs to the period of Rajaraja I. <br />
<br />
The Swasthik tank in the temple finds mention in one of the <br />
inscriptions, which calls it `Maarpidugu Perunkinaru' and it was <br />
believed to have been dug up by Maarpidugu Ilangovelan Sathan, a <br />
feudal lord under Pallava kings. <br />
<br />
There are also inscriptions of Hoysala kings here. <br />
<br />
There is another cave temple carved out of a rock known as <br />
Swedhagiri where Lord Siva, known as `Vada Jambunathar' and <br />
Pundarikaksha are enshrined. <br />
<br />
Inscriptions belonging to the period of the Pallava King <br />
Nandivarman, who won the battle of Thellaru, have also been found in <br />
this place. <br />
<br />
The Saivite holy place of Thiruppaingneeli is situated near <br />
Thiruvellarai. <br />
