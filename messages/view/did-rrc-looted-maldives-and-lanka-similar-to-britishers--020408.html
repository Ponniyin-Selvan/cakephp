read this in context ...first he destroys their capital, sea port - <br />
strategically to assert and cement his position - then starts a <br />
systematic process of creating land divisions named after him/his <br />
country, renames road, places etc....builds temples, positions lots <br />
of his people there...even used the revenues to fund the big temple. <br />
this was no loot - this was an invasion/occupation - a well planned <br />
naval assault aimed at annexing the land.<br />

  A BRIEF HISTORICAL SURVEY <br />
  ON THE RELATIONS OF THE CHOLAS OF TAMILNADU<br />
  WITH THE SINHALAS OF SRI LANKA<br />
  DURING THE MEDIEVAL PERIOD<br />
  {A.D.849 - A.D 1122}<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  (1) The Re-Emergence of the Chola Kingdom<br />
  <br />
  From the beginning of the second half of nineth century, the <br />
Cholas <br />
  gradually re-emerged as a powerful ruling dynasty of Tamilnadu, <br />
after <br />
  a long spell of nearly six centuries both in political obscurity <br />
and <br />
  as feudatory of the Kalabra, Pallava and Pandiya dynasties of <br />
South <br />
  India.<br />
  <br />
  (2) Vijayaalaya Chola reigns from his capital Palaiyaarai in <br />
Tamilnadu<br />
  <br />
  In the line of these Cholas sprung king Vijayaalaya Chola (A.D.849-<br />
  881) ruling a small central region of the present Tamilnadu state <br />
  with his capital at Palaiyaarai, and as a feudatory of the Pallava <br />
  king Nandivarman - 3 (A.D.826-850).<br />
  <br />
  (3) Vijayaalaya Chola builds his new capital at Thanjaavur<br />
  <br />
  In the year A.D.852 Vijayaalaya Chola waged war with the <br />
Muttaraiyar <br />
  king Sattan Paliyilli (A.D.826-852) in the neighbouring east, and <br />
  captured his territory of Thanjaavur.<br />
  <br />
  Vijayalaya Chola built his new capital at Thanjaavur with all <br />
  facilities of a city commencing with the construction of a temple <br />
to <br />
  the Goddess Kaali named as Nisumbasudani. The Chola country of <br />
this <br />
  period covered the central and the eastern regions of the present <br />
  Tamilnadu state.<br />
  <br />
  (4) King of Sri Lanka awaits to avenge the invasion of his country <br />
by <br />
  Pandiya<br />
  <br />
  During this period the Sri Lankan king Sena-2 (A.D.851-885) was <br />
  awaiting an opportune moment to avenge the devastation and <br />
disgrace <br />
  caused to Sri Lanka by an earlier invasion of the Pandiya king <br />
  Srimara Sri Vallaba (A.D.835-862) which took place during the rule <br />
of <br />
  Sena-1(A.D.831-851). <br />
  <br />
  (5) Rebellious son of Pandiya seeks help from Sri Lanka<br />
  <br />
  Towards this time a son of Srimara Sri Vallaba by one of his other <br />
  queens, named Maya Pandiya claimed rights to succession against <br />
  Varaguna Pandiya-2 the legitimate heir to the throne by the chief <br />
  queen of Srimara Sri Vallaba. This son with dissension with his <br />
  father over same resolved to take over the Pandiya kingdom to <br />
himself <br />
  and went to Sri Lanka to seek the assistance of the king Sena-2.<br />
  <br />
  (6) Sri Lankan forces invades and captures the Pandiya country<br />
  <br />
  Taking opportunity of the prevailing conditions, the king of Sri <br />
  Lanka the Sena-2 sent a large army under his general named <br />
Kutthaka, <br />
  who crossed seas from the port of Mahatittha the present Mantota <br />
and <br />
  invaded the Pandiya country in the year A.D.862, killed Srimara <br />
Sri <br />
  Vallaba laid waste the region, and captured the capitol city of <br />
the <br />
  Pandiya the Madurai. However Varaguna Pandiya  2 escaped capture <br />
and <br />
  went into hiding. <br />
  <br />
  (7) The Sri Lankan forces crown the rebellious son on the Pandiya <br />
  throne<br />
     <br />
  The Sri Lankan forces thereafter anointed as the king the <br />
rebellious <br />
  son of Srimara Sri Vallaba the Maya Pandiya who seeked their <br />
  assistance to gain the throne, and returned to Sri Lanka with much <br />
of <br />
  the earlier lost treasures of the Sinhala country.<br />
  <br />
  (8) Pallava king Nirupatunga assists Varaguna to regain throne<br />
  <br />
  Varaguna Pandiya-2 requested the assistance of the Pallava king <br />
  Nirupatunga (A.D.850-882) to retrieve his throne. The Pallava king <br />
  along with Vijayaalaya Chola and his allies invaded and defeated <br />
the <br />
  rebellious son of Pandiya and drove away the remaining Sinhala <br />
forces <br />
  and reinstated Varaguna Pandiya - 2 (A.D.862-880) on throne at <br />
  Madurai in the year A.D.862.<br />
  <br />
  (9) Aathiththa Chola ascends the Chola throne<br />
  <br />
  Vijayaalaya Chola appointed his son Aathiththa Chola (A.D.871-907) <br />
as <br />
  his co-regent in the year A.D.871. He succeeded on the Chola <br />
throne <br />
  at Thanjavur in the year A.D.881 with the demise of Vijayaalaya <br />
  Chola.  <br />
  <br />
  (10) Aathiththa Chola recovers the regions of the Chola country <br />
  <br />
  During his period in the year A.D.880 Varaguna Pandiya - 2 waged <br />
war <br />
  with the Pallava king Nirupathunga successor to Nandivarman, with <br />
  whom he had friendly relations earlier. The Aathitha Chola assited <br />
  the Pallavas against Pandiya in this war at Thiruppurambiam. The <br />
  Pallavas won the battle and Aathiththa Chola too was benefitted by <br />
  being able to recover the entire Chola country. In the year A.D. <br />
890 <br />
  he invaded and captured the Thondainadu and put an end to the <br />
Pallava <br />
  dynasty with Aparajitha (A.D.882-890) the son of Nirupathunga. <br />
  <br />
  (11) Paranthaha Chola captures the Pandiya kingdom<br />
  <br />
  Athiththa died while in Thondainadu, and was suceeded by his son <br />
king <br />
  Paranthaha Chola (A.D.907-954) at Thanjavur, who in the year <br />
A.D.910 <br />
  captured the Pandiya country the southern region of the present <br />
Tamil <br />
  Nadu state. The Pandiya king Rajasimhan-3 (A.D.905-921) few years <br />
  after his defeat, escaped from his hiding to Sri Lanka and <br />
requested <br />
  the Sinhala king Kasyappa-5 (A.D.913-923) to assist him in <br />
regaining <br />
  his kingdom.<br />
  <br />
  (12) Pandiya King's second battle with Paranthaha Chola<br />
  <br />
  In the year A.D.919 king Kasyappa sent a large Sinhala force under <br />
  his general Saka Senapathi to assist Rajasimhan to recapture his <br />
  kingdom. However Paranthaha's forces along with the forces of his <br />
  ally the Kannada king Piruthivi-2, defeated the combined forces of <br />
  Pandiya and the Sinhala forces, in a deadly battle at Vellur. <br />
  <br />
  (13) Pandiya King escapes to Sri Lanka with Regalia<br />
  <br />
  However the Pandiya king Rajasimhan escaped capture by Cholas, and <br />
  went to Sri Lanka with his crown and the other royal insignia and <br />
  took shelter in the Sinhala kingdom. He seeked further assistance <br />
  from the new Sinhala king Dappula-4 (A.D.923-934) in regaining his <br />
  kingdom. He on not receiving favourable response from Dappula-4 <br />
due <br />
  to heavy repraisels from his nobles against same, left back his <br />
crown <br />
  and insignia with him, and took asylum in the Chera country the <br />
  present south Kerala state.<br />
  <br />
  (14) Paranthaha Chola wages war with Sri Lanka.  <br />
  <br />
  Paranthaha Chola now requested the next successor to the Sri Lanka <br />
  throne the Udaya-3 (A.D.934-937) to return the Pandiya crown and <br />
  insignia, and on the latter's refusal Paranthaha in the year <br />
A.D.944 <br />
  crossed seas to Sri Lanka, and defeated the king Udaya-3 who <br />
  retreated from his capital Anuradhapura to Rohana in south Sri <br />
Lanka <br />
  with the Pandiyan treasure.<br />
  <br />
  (15) Paranthaha Chola fails in his mission<br />
  <br />
  Paranthaha finding difficult to penetrate into Rohana returned to <br />
  Chola country with much booty and treasures from Lanka, but <br />
failing <br />
  in his mission to retrieve the Pandiyan crown and royal insignia <br />
from <br />
  king Udaya-3. However Paranthaha with the defeat of the Sinhala <br />
king <br />
  assumed the new title the Singhalanthahan.<br />
  <br />
  (16) Gandarathiththa Chola looses Pandiya Country <br />
  <br />
  Paranthaha-1 was suceeeded on the Chola throne at Thanjavur by his <br />
  second son Gandarathiththa Chola (A.D.950-957), who spent almost <br />
his <br />
  entire period of rule in spiritualism as an ardent Saivite, and <br />
  finally was counted as one of the 63 great Saiva Saints of <br />
TamilNadu.<br />
  <br />
  (17) Arinjaya's short rule of Chola kingdom<br />
  <br />
  He was followed by his younger brother Arinjaya Chola (A.D956-957) <br />
at <br />
  Thanjavur, who had very short rule.<br />
  <br />
  (18) Chola Forces goes to Sri Lanka to assist the Commander Sena<br />
  <br />
  He was followed by his son Sundera Chola (A.D.957-973) on the <br />
throne <br />
  at Thanjavur. During this period the Sri Lankan commander with <br />
much <br />
  animosity with his own king Sena-5 (A.D972-981) came to Chola <br />
country <br />
  and seeked military assistance from Sundera Chola, who sent as <br />
much <br />
  as 95,000 troops to Sri Lanka led by thr Chola General Paranthahan <br />
  Siriya Velan in A.D.954.<br />
  <br />
  (19) Chola General Meets his death in the battle in Sri Lanka<br />
  <br />
  In this battle Sena-5 was defeated and escaped to Rohana, but the <br />
  Chola commander met his death which made the forces to return to <br />
  their country.<br />
  <br />
  (20) Rule of Utthama Chola <br />
  <br />
  After the death of Sundera Chola in A.D.973 the lawful successor <br />
  prince Rajaraja Chola gave way to his paternal uncle Utthama Chola <br />
  (A.D.973-985) who was craving for the Chola throne, on the <br />
  understanding that the succession to the throne at Thanjavur to be <br />
  passed on to prince Rajaraja after the death of Utthama Chola.<br />
  <br />
  (21) Rajaraja-1 succeeds on the Chola throne<br />
  <br />
  Likewise in the the year A.D.985 Rajaraja  1 came into power. <br />
During <br />
  this period in Sri Lanka king Mahinda-V (A.D.981-1029) ruling from <br />
  Anuradhapura in the wake of an internal rebellion by the Kerala <br />
  mercineries of his troops retreated to Rohana in A.D.991, and <br />
  continued to rule the southern half of the island.<br />
  <br />
  This left the northern half in turmoil with no king for nearly <br />
eleven <br />
  years with various chieftains yeilding power from time to time <br />
over <br />
  territories in this region and a state of anarchy prevailed. <br />
Rajaraja <br />
  taking advantage of the situation crossed seas and invaded Sri <br />
Lanka <br />
  in his seventeenth year the A.D.1002. His great army known <br />
  as "muntrukai mahasenai' sacked the seaport city of Mathottam the <br />
  present Mantota and the interior capital of Anuradhapura, and <br />
annexed <br />
  the northen half of the island to his empire.<br />
  <br />
  Rajaraja too on his victory over the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka <br />
assumed <br />
  the a new title as Sinhalanthahan, and a village in Thanjavur in <br />
  Tamilnadu was named after this title as Singalanthahacchcheri.<br />
  <br />
  (22) Polonnaruwa made the Chola capital in Sri Lanka.<br />
  <br />
  He named the captured northern half of Sri Lanka as Mummudi-<br />
  Cholamandalam after another of his titles, and further divided and <br />
  named them into various provinces. The present Polonnaruwa which <br />
  formed a part of the province Nigarili Cholavalanadu was made the <br />
new <br />
  capital of his island territorial possessions and was named as <br />
  Jananathamangalam also known as Jananathapuram.<br />
  <br />
  (23) Tamil Trading Settlements established in Sri Lanka  <br />
  <br />
  During this period of Chola occupation the Tamil trading guilds <br />
  Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar also known as Nanadesi Thisaiayirathu <br />
  Annuruvar and Nanadesis, the Valanjiyar and Nagaratthar who were <br />
  already trading in Sri Lanka further increased their activities in <br />
  the Island.<br />
  <br />
  At Kataneri the present Vahalkade in the Anuradhapura district the <br />
  guild of Thisaiayyiratththu Annuruvar established a mercantile <br />
town <br />
  known as Virapattinam. Among the members of this guild was a <br />
trader <br />
  of high rank named Kanavathi Cholan alias Mavittamuriparan, a <br />
Chetti <br />
  trader from Java and an officer in charge of a mint in this town.<br />
  <br />
  At Padaviya in the Anuradhapura district too there was a trading <br />
  establishment of this guild , and also a Siva temple in this area <br />
  under their protection. One of the traders here too was of a high <br />
  rank in the trading guild named Uththama Cholan alias Mandalattu <br />
  Chetti, and another named Kottaikutpatan Cholan alias Kollarun <br />
Cinkan.<br />
  <br />
  At Viharehinna near Moragolla in north Matale district <br />
  Thisaiayiratthu Annuruvar had established another mercantile town <br />
  known as the Virapattinam.<br />
  <br />
  There had been further trading establishements of this guild at <br />
  Ilakattu Eba in Chilaw district, and at Detiyamulla and <br />
Gaitenpitiya <br />
  both in Kurunagala district.<br />
  <br />
  In Polonnaruwa near the Rankot Vihara there had been a Buddhist <br />
  Vihare known as Bholapalli at the village Bahicintai under the <br />
  patronage of the guild of Thisaiayiraathu Annuruvar.<br />
  <br />
  (24) Chola officials build Hindu Temples in Sri Lanka  <br />
  <br />
  During this period Chola Officials and Tamil traders built many <br />
Hindu <br />
  Temples for worship of Siva and Vishnu in the northern half of Sri <br />
  Lanka.<br />
  <br />
  A Siva temple was built at Jananathamangalam also known as <br />
  Jananathpuram the present Polonnaruwa in the province of Nigarili <br />
  Cholavalanadu alias Pulainari, and was named as Vanavanmadevi <br />
Iswarem <br />
  after the queen of Raja Raja - 1.<br />
  <br />
  They built another Sive temple at Padaviya in the Anuradhapura <br />
  disctrict and named it as Ravikulamaanikka Iswarem after one of <br />
the <br />
  titles of Rajaraja. Many Chola officials and traders around <br />
fifteen <br />
  of them have made endowements to this temple, and Chenkulavan <br />
  Katampan being one of them made donations in the year A.D.1005.<br />
  <br />
  A further Siva Temple was built at Padaviya and was named as <br />
  Uththamar Koyil and there was also a brahmin settlement <br />
established <br />
  in this area known as `Sripathi grama'<br />
  <br />
  There was yet another Siva temple constructed at Atakade in the <br />

(Kathirkamam).<br />
  <br />
  The Chola general stationed at Polonnaruwa not withstanding this <br />
sent <br />
  an army to Kattaragama against Kasspa in which the Chola forces <br />
were <br />
  defeated and retreated to the north. Kassapa now set up his <br />
northern <br />
  frontier at Rakkhapasana the present Rakwana and returd to <br />

  <br />
  At this time the prince named Kitti the nephew of Vikkramabahu <br />

  both being in present Burma, requesting for military assistance <br />
  against Cholas.<br />
  <br />
  King Anuruddha on the other hand with no intention to create any <br />

hostile <br />
  and paid no tributes to the Chola kingdom. Vijayabahu too <br />
continued <br />
  with his attempts to oust Cholas from Sri Lanka. <br />
  <br />
  This made Virarajendra to send a fresh expedition to Sri Lanka in <br />
the <br />
  year A.D.1067 with many ships of large forces to the port of <br />
  Mathottam in north Sri Lanka under the general Kurukulaththaraiyan.<br />

  with his forces where two mighty warriors of Vijayabahu, Ravideva <br />
  and Cala joined the Chola forces and fought against him.<br />
  <br />
  In this battle the Chola general Kurukulatharaiyan, and another <br />
  commander lost their lives. This made Chola forces more furious in <br />
  which Rohana again fell into the hands of the Cholas who took <br />

  assasinated and a state of anrachy prevailed in the kingdom.<br />
