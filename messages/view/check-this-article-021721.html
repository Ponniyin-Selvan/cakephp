lots of questions asked: <br />
<br />
1. are bronzes crafted in nude ? dont think so - most of them<br />
display the clothing during the times they were made. if so current<br />
day when the bronzes are brought out - they are beddecked with<br />
jewels and clothing - is this a later day habit. why make a statue<br />
with clothes sculpted and then again wrap it in cloth??<br />
<br />
2. are bronzes to be exhibited as such ( as pieces of art) or as<br />
they are displayed in our temples - with all the clothing etc<br />
<br />
3. check the reference to chola empire being brought down by<br />
muslims!! muslims from the north...<br />
<br />
4. check the reference to <acronym title="Rajendra Cholan">RJC</acronym> - as gangai kinda - capturer of<br />
ganges....<br />
<br />
5. One crown for just one statue (a crown described in detail on a<br />
Chola temple wall) contained four pounds of gold. It also had set<br />
into it 859 diamonds, 309 "large and small rubies" and 669<br />

Bronze Beauties<br />
At the Sackler, South India's Chola Statues Cast the Gods in an<br />
Earthy, Enticing Light<br />
<br />
By Paul Richard<br />
Special to The Washington Post<br />
Sunday, November 17, 2002; Page G01<br />
<br />
People who respond to nakedness in art, and that's a lot of people,<br />
will discover much to ogle -- and to wonder at -- in "The Sensuous<br />
and the Sacred: Chola Bronzes from South India" at the Arthur M.<br />
Sackler Gallery, a serene and sexy show whose 1,000-year-old statues<br />
remind you that the highest human beauty can pierce you like a ray.<br />
<br />
That's why we call movie stars "goddesses."<br />
<br />
The goddesses at the Sackler (and the men aren't half bad, either)<br />
are full-breasted and slim-waisted. Their garments are transparent,<br />
and they don't just stand there sticklike; their pliant bodies sway.<br />
<br />
People who confuse piety with prudery may have to stretch their<br />
minds to see what every Hindu knows, that a perfect body dancing in<br />
abandon can radiate a splendor that goes beyond the human and<br />
partakes of the divine.<br />
<br />
Almost all these graceful deities, even those with male names, have<br />
something feminine about them. The Shiva from the Cleveland Museum<br />
of Art appears upon a trident and is half man and half woman. And<br />
when that great god dances the world into creation, a mermaid Mother<br />
Ganges is seen swimming in his hair. Almost all these gods have<br />
goddesses beside them: Krishna has his Rukmini, Rama has his Sita,<br />
and great Vishnu is accompanied by ripely female figures -- the<br />
goddess of the earth, the goddess of good fortune -- who are aspects<br />
of himself.<br />
<br />
All the statues in the Sackler show are of the gods. No, that's not<br />
quite right. Those objects are receptacles, vehicles devised for<br />
divinity to enter -- which divinity would do when the right prayers<br />
were recited and the proper gifts bestowed.<br />
<br />
Towering stone buildings were constructed to contain these sacred<br />
metal figures. The great temple at Tanjavur, completed in 1010, is<br />
20 stories tall. The portable bronzes at the Sackler are only two or<br />
three feet high, and tiny in comparison, but like that immense<br />
palace they are abodes for the gods.<br />
<br />
Hinduism's deities enjoy big shifts in scale. The monotheists' God<br />
is an abstract one-and-only who tends to be envisioned, when<br />
glimpsed at all, as invisible, unknowable and beyond comprehension.<br />
India's gods are that, too, but they are not that only. Most of them<br />
are shape-shifters, constantly in flux. Shiva, while infinite, is<br />
also Somaskanda, the family man, and Tripuravijaya, the warrior,<br />
and, of course, they are also their own wives, and Nataraja, the<br />
great dancer, and a beggar smeared with ash.<br />
<br />
India's greatest gods are tiny, too. Vishnu, though a deity<br />
transcendent and supreme, is small enough to rest upon a banyan<br />
leaf. Mother Ganges in this show is usually a miniature. Ganesha<br />
rides a mouse.<br />
<br />
No one form is sufficient for deities so changeable. Nor will a<br />
single statue do. India's Chola bronzes almost always come in sets.<br />
<br />
There are well-attended temples every six or seven miles throughout<br />
the Tamil-speaking regions of southeastern India, and nearly all<br />
possess complex suites of bronzes -- 20, 60, maybe more -- much like<br />
those on view.<br />
<br />
They wouldn't be displayed this way in India. We see more than we're<br />
supposed to in the Sackler's exhibition, more nipples and navels and<br />
flesh. India's gods, superb though their bodies are, do not go out<br />
naked. When taken to the sea to bathe, or carried on their morning<br />
rounds, the bronzes at the Sackler would always appear clothed.<br />
<br />
Long ago, in Chola times, in the 9th through the 12th centuries,<br />
seeing them was wonderful. Richard H. Davis, writing in the<br />
catalogue, imagines the experience: <br />
<br />
"Viewers would have heard, first of all, the exciting clamor of<br />
drums and the resounding tones of conch shells heralding the arrival<br />
of the images. As the crowd approached they would have seen the<br />
leader of the parade on an ornamented, caparisoned elephant holding<br />
a banner aloft. Men chanting hymns and woman dancers from the temple<br />
would pass by. Then, in the crush of people pushing to get closer,<br />
they would have seen the bronze figures nearly hidden beneath silk<br />
garments, gold ornaments, and garlands of flowers, shaded by<br />
parasols, parading forth from their temple palaces into the torch-<br />
lit streets."<br />
<br />
"Barely an inch of bronze," writes Vidya Dehejia, the exhibition's<br />
curator, would have been "visible to the eyes of devotees." The<br />
Cholas were a dynasty of great wealth. They grew rice, and they<br />
fought, and they made sure that their gods were as lavishly<br />
provisioned as they were attired. Chola temple bronzes were<br />
regularly anointed with milk, curds, holy water, sugar, sandalwood<br />
paste and melted butter. The worn smoothness of these bronzes shows<br />
how often they were rubbed.<br />
<br />
Chola temple bronzes were regally bedecked. One crown for just one<br />
statue (a crown described in detail on a Chola temple wall)<br />
contained four pounds of gold. It also had set into it 859 diamonds,<br />
309 "large and small rubies" and 669 pearls.<br />
<br />
In offering such lavish gifts -- a number are on view -- the Cholas<br />
were displaying their own wealth.<br />
<br />
The empire they ruled from 850 to 1279 was one of India's richest.<br />
The ambitious Rajaraja who assumed the Chola throne in 985 (his name<br />
means "King of Kings") conquered the Maldive Islands and all of Sri<br />
Lanka, and sent missions to Indonesia. His son Rajenda campaigned as<br />
far north as the Ganges, that holiest of rivers, and after bringing<br />
back its water in a set of golden pots assumed the title Gangai-<br />
kinda, which means "Capturer of the Ganges."<br />
<br />
Before the Chola heyday the temples of the region had been largely<br />
built of brick. Now most were made of stone. The statues they<br />
contained had once been made of wood. Now the best were cast, as<br />
these were, in long-lasting bronze.<br />
<br />
The Chola empire didn't last. Empires seldom do. Muslims from the<br />
north eventually saw to its demise. But the graceful Chola style --<br />
sort of like the Gothic of medieval France -- never went out of<br />
vogue. Bronze-casters in South India are still obeying its<br />
conventions -- as American universities still boast Gothic dorms.<br />
<br />
A seated Brahma at the Sackler has four faces on one head. Dancing<br />
Shiva has four separate arms. Many Western viewers may find these<br />
statues alien, but the longer you look the more familiar they become.<br />
<br />
Among the easiest to "get" is a 13th-century bronze (from the<br />
Metropolitan Museum of Art) that shows Yashoda nursing baby Krishna.<br />
<br />
Though Krishna is a god, of course, and an incarnation of Vishnu, he<br />
was as humbly raised as Jesus, and grew up among cowherds. Yashoda<br />
was his foster mother. The sacredness of mother-love, so often the<br />
theme of Renaissance Madonnas, is as movingly depicted in this<br />
gentle and maternal Indian sculpture.<br />
<br />
Another European image somehow echoed at the Sackler is that of the<br />
femme fatale, who combines love with death. In Homer she's a siren<br />
who, singing irresistibly, lures sailors to destruction. In the<br />
prints of Norway's Edvard Munch, she's a long-haired vampire with<br />
fangs. At the Sackler she's a saint.<br />
<br />
Her name was Karaikkal, and her beauty was renowned, but Karaikkal<br />
so loved immortal Shiva that she relinquished her good looks to<br />
adore the god beyond physical distractions. In fact, she turned into<br />
a ghoul. Here is how one sacred Chola text describes her: <br />
<br />
She has shriveled breasts<br />
<br />
and bulging veins,<br />
<br />
in place of white teeth<br />
<br />
empty cavities gape . . .<br />
<br />
the demon-woman wails at the desolate cremation ground<br />
<br />
where our lord . . .<br />
<br />
dances among the flames . . .<br />
<br />
In an 11th-century bronze from the Nelson-Atkins Museum, she is<br />
scrawny, green and fanged. Her dirty hair is matted. Her ribs show<br />
through her flaccid skin. Only her surprising breasts retain the<br />
nymphlike beauty that she abandoned for her god.<br />
<br />
Throughout southern India bronze statues like those in "The Sensuous<br />
and the Sacred" are still anointed daily, and regularly worshiped.<br />
But the objects at the Sackler -- there are some 70 on view -- were<br />
not sent here by temples. The finest are on loan, instead, from<br />
establishment museums in Switzerland and Holland, England, Germany<br />
and France -- which means it has been years, and in many cases<br />
decades, since the gods chose to inhabit them. The holy vehicles at<br />
the Sackler are now just works of art.<br />
<br />
