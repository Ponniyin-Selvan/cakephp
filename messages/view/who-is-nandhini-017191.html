    Hi,<br />
    Here I would like to clarify one point that has been <br />
disturbing <br />
  my mind for sometime : <br />
       <br />
    How old was Senthan Amudhan when Nandini and the old <br />
Madurantakan <br />
  were born?<br />
       <br />
    When Mandakini jumped off the light house, she was pregnant <br />
  wasn't she?<br />
       <br />
    Kalki says Mandakini and Veera pandiyan were rescued by <br />
  Karuthirumman and when she was rescued, she was pregnant. Is it <br />
  possible that she had met Veera pandiyan even before that? That <br />
has <br />
  not been mentioned right? And it is also said that Oomai Rani gave <br />
  birth to twins in "Sembiyan Madevi"s palace and that the <br />
replacement <br />
  happened after a few days of the birth of Senthan amudhan. Which <br />
  means right after Senthan amudhan was born, the twins were born. <br />
But <br />
  it is also said When the Pattabhishekam of sundara chozhar <br />
  happened,kandarathitha chozhar's son(Madurantakan) was one year <br />
old. <br />
  I think only because of that reason the guards went searching for <br />
  Sundara chozhar in the first place. And during the pattabhishekam <br />
  Oomai rani tried to kill herself by falling off the light house <br />
and <br />
  then was rescued and found to be pregnant. Now don't you think <br />
that <br />
  is confusing? <br />
       <br />
    Please correct me if my argument is wrong.<br />
       <br />
    Thanks<br />

    <br />
    Who is Nandini?<br />
    <br />
    When Ram (our moderator) approached me for a weekly article <br />
based <br />
    on the discussions that we have in the group, I was wondering <br />
how <br />
    to start. After much head scratching I thought I would like to <br />
    begin this series with a question which pops in all our minds <br />
while <br />
    we read this great epic  "Who is Nandini?"<br />
    <br />
    I wonder if there was a more complex character created at all by <br />
    any author. And the way Kalki builds her character through the <br />
    entire novel is beautiful. In each part, episode and dialogue we <br />
    get to know a new facet about her character and equally a new <br />
    secret about her life.<br />
    <br />
    Right from the beginning of this epic, we see conflicting images <br />
    that this character portrays. Initially we know her as a mystery <br />
    woman in a palanquin and then slowly Kalki reveals her history. <br />
    When Azhvarkadiyan narrates her story we feel sorry for her but <br />
she <br />
    presents a conflicting image when our hero meets her. After <br />
    listening to Azhvarkadiyan's story we are prepared to meet a <br />
    helpless girl who was kidnapped and forced to wed an old man but <br />
    when Vandiya Devan meets her for the first time she appears to <br />
be <br />
    powerful woman with a fleet of servants to do her bidding and <br />
she <br />
    also wields enough power to help him get inside the Fort.<br />
    <br />
    After Vandiya Devan meets her we know that she is an <br />
exceptionally <br />
    beautiful woman. And what better way could there be to compare <br />
her <br />
    beauty with that of Kundavai's than through a man's eyes! But it <br />
is <br />
    certain that Nandini's magnetism and beauty are unparalleled in <br />
the <br />
    novel and she cleverly uses it as a lever to wrap men around her <br />
    little finger. She has a success rate of 99% in creating love <br />
sick <br />
    puppies like Pazhuvetar, Kandanmaran, Aditya Karikalan, Pallava <br />
    Parthibendran etc. But she meets her match in Vandiya Devan who <br />
is <br />
    unfazed by her hypnotic beauty.<br />
    <br />
    The war of will between these two characters is beautiful. <br />
    flirtatious yet determined, condescending yet clever Vandiya <br />
Devan <br />
    escapes from being pulled into Nandini's dangerous web.<br />
    <br />
    Why does Nandini try to entrap Vandiya Devan? Kalki gives us the <br />
    reason immediately because he does not want his audience to get <br />
the <br />
    wrong impression about her. She is associated with the Pandya <br />
spies <br />
    who want avenge their king's death. <br />
    <br />
    Through the course of the novel we see different kaleidoscopic <br />
    mages of her as a Schemer, Strategist, Leader and also as an <br />
    unfortunate woman whose life was manipulated by many people.<br />
    <br />
    Coming back to our basic question, "Who is she?" We know for <br />
sure <br />
    that she is Mandakini's daughter but who is her father? Is it <br />
    Veerapandiyan or Karuthiruman?<br />
    <br />
    I think we can safely leave Sundara Chola out of the discussion <br />
    because both Nandini and Madhuranthakan were born two years <br />
after <br />
    Sundara Chola returned to the Kingdom.<br />
    <br />
    The crux of the problem is Mandakini's loss of memory. <br />
Karuthiruman <br />
    saves her from her suicide attempt during which she looses her <br />
    emory <br />
    and takes her back to Boodha Thevu and on the way he rescues <br />
    Veerapandiyan who is fleeing from the Cholas.<br />
    <br />
    Karuthiruman leaves them both in the Boodha Thevu and takes the <br />
    Pandya King's message to the Sri Lanka King. Did Veerapandiyan <br />
fall <br />
    in love with her? Did Mandakini have an affair with him? <br />
    <br />
    Now let's discuss the other possibility. Karuthiruman confesses <br />
to <br />
    Azhvarkadiyan that he is the father of Nandini and <br />
Madhuranthakan. <br />
    Could this be true? We know that later he falls in love with <br />
Vani, <br />
    Mandakini's twin sister. Could that be because he was reminded <br />
of <br />
    Mandakini who by then had regained her memory and could not <br />
    recognize him?<br />
    <br />
    The truth can only be guessed by the actions of these two <br />
    individuals after they meet Mandakini. Veerapandiyan sends <br />
    Karuthiruman as a messenger to Mandakini who was taken back to <br />
Kodi <br />
    Karai by her father. But when he arrives there he finds that <br />
    Mandakini has had another accident with result her memory is <br />
back. <br />
    Now she does not recognize Karuthiruman, which means she does <br />
not <br />
    know what happened to her from the time she fell from the <br />
    lighthouse and her last accident. <br />
    <br />
    Why did Veerapandiyan send a message through Karuthiruman to <br />
her? <br />
    was he in love with her? Going by the fact that Nandini <br />
resembles <br />
    Mandakini we can conclude that Mandakini too was an <br />
exceptionally <br />
    beautiful woman barring the fact that she was handicapped. If we <br />
    assume that he had an affair with her, this fits in perfectly <br />
    because I cannot imagine what other business a king like <br />
    Veerapandiyan would have with her. And that too, a king who has <br />
    been ousted from his kingdom and who is in Sri Lanka trying to <br />
    rally support. One would think that he has lots of things in <br />
mind <br />
    other than to wonder about an unfortunate woman with whom he had <br />
    traveled for a short while unless he had developed a special <br />
love <br />
    or affection for her. Only that could have prompted him find out <br />
    what happened to her.<br />
    <br />
    Veerapandiyan is persistently trying to find out what happened <br />
to <br />
    her. Did he know that she was pregnant with his baby? <br />
Karuthiruman <br />
    finds out that Veerapandiyan's children are being brought up in <br />
    Chola household but before he could get this information to the <br />
  king <br />
    he is captured and thrown in prison. Maybe Veerapandiyan knows <br />
that <br />
    she was pregnant but doesn't know what happened to the babies or <br />
to <br />
    their mother.<br />
    <br />
    Ram had earlier raised a question in the group saying that <br />
    Veerapandiyan who is rescued by Karuthiruman is the father of <br />
the <br />
    Veerapandiyan who is killed by Karikalan. (Ref: <br />
   </p><br /><p><a target="_blank" href="/redirect.php?uri=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ponniyinselvan/message/1" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/...onniyinselvan/message/1</a></p><p>) That is <br />
    also possible because I think there is a gap of atleast 20  22 <br />
    years before Veerapandiyan meets Mandakini and later on Nandini. <br />
    Either way we get the same answer  Nandini is Veerapandiyan's <br />
    daughter.<br />
    <br />
    The second possibility is that Karuthiruman might be the father <br />
of <br />
    Nandini and Madhuranthakan. But I find very little evidence to <br />
    suggest that. All his actions prove that he has been acting for <br />
the <br />
    Pandya King. So it would be safe to assume that he had lied to <br />
    Azhvarkadiyan. But there is also one little point that we must <br />
    vote. When Karuthiruman narrates his story to Vandiya Devan he <br />
    starts with a preamble that  "Is it Ok if I combine some <br />
    imagination as well along with the story?" Now which part of it <br />
is <br />
    imagination is difficult for me to concur.<br />
    <br />
    After the babies are born, Sembiyanmadevi gives away Nandini to <br />
    Azhvarkadiyan's parents. Sembiyanmadevi does not approve of <br />
    Nandini's friendship with Karikalan and she sends away Nandini <br />
to <br />
    Pandya Kingdom. There can be another reason for this. Nandini <br />
and <br />
    Madhuranthakan are identical twins, maybe she didn't want <br />
anybody <br />
    to wonder how come they both look alike.<br />
    <br />
    When the final war between Veerapandiyan and Chola armies takes <br />
    place the soldiers bring the wounded Veerapandiyan to Nandini's <br />
    house. And Nandini takes care of him and tries to save him from <br />
the <br />
    Chola soldiers. Did she do it only because she wants to get back <br />
at <br />
    the Cholas for all the insults that were thrown upon her by <br />
    Kundavai? Or was it because she had realized that Veerapandiyan <br />
was <br />
    her father? <br />
    What would have been Veerapandiyan's reaction when he saw <br />
Nandini? <br />
    I am sure it must have been easy for him to work out the fact <br />
that <br />
    Nandini's mother was Mandakini hence his daughter. And he must <br />
have <br />
    told her so as well.<br />
    <br />
    But Nandini confuses us all by declaring to Karikalan that <br />
    Veerapandiyan is her lover. And this declaration takes place in <br />
the <br />
    presence of Veerapandiyan who is alive and kicking. How could <br />
she <br />
    have declared that if she had known that he is her father? <br />
    Same argument can be put across if we go by Ram's query. If she <br />
had <br />
    realized that Veerapandiyan is her brother, how can she call her <br />
    brother as a lover? Now this is where I am not able to apply any <br />
    logic!<br />
    <br />
    Does she say that because she feels that Karikalan might kill <br />
him <br />
    if he knew the truth? But if she is so bent upon saving him she <br />
    needn't have told him anything at all let alone this. If she had <br />
    plainly put across the fact that she just saved a wounded man <br />
and <br />
    that might have done the trick. Karikalan would not have got <br />
into a <br />
    mad rage. <br />
    <br />
    Ravidasan mentions once that she had miscalculated Karikalan. <br />
She <br />
    had belief in her beauty with which she was able to get all her <br />
    wishes fulfilled but her own power backfired on her. Karikalan <br />
in <br />
    his mad love and frenzy kills the man who he thinks is her lover.<br />
    <br />
    Could he have got it wrong? Is it possible that Nandini might <br />
have <br />
    meant something else while he got it wrong? Quite possible. Even <br />
    Vandiya Devan suggests the same thing in the last few chapters <br />
    where he and Kundavai are also breaking their heads about this!<br />
    <br />
    Going ahead with the assumption that she is Veerapandiyan's <br />
    daughter it is no surprise that she took her revenge on <br />
Karikalan <br />
    the way she did. <br />
    <br />
    Well here I rest my case. I am eager to know what everybody else <br />
    thinks about these arguements of mine. Next week, I will try to <br />
    unravel as to who could be Nandini's true love.<br />
