References to and the location of Palanthivukal:<br />
<br />
Among the near overseas territories conquered by Rajaraja Chola - 1<br />
{A.D.985-1014} and Rajendra Chola - 1{A.D.1012-1044} other than Sri <br />
Lanka and Saanthimaththivu, were the "Palanthivukal". They are <br />
presently referred to, partly as Maldive Islands coming under <br />
separate rule, and partly as Laccadive Islands (Lakshadweep) coming <br />
under the rule of mainland India.<br />
<br />
Rajaraja's conquer of "Palanthivukal", is refered to in his <br />
Meikeerthi in Tamil as "Munneer Palanthivu Panneer ayiram" meaning <br />
the "old islands tweleve thousand of the sea".<br />
<br />
Rajendra's conquer of "Palanthivukal" is refered to as "Sangathir <br />
velaith thol perung kaaval pal Palanthivum" in Tamil in his <br />
Meikeerthi meaning the "ancient many old islands with waves  <br />
resounding conches and having strong guard" <br />
<br />
The first mention of this place name - namely the "Palanthivukal" <br />
meaning "Old Islands" in Tamil  is found in an early Tamil Grammer <br />
Work known as "Akaththiyar Vaakku", quoted in another 12th Century <br />
Tamil Grammer Work known as the "Nannool" by one of it's commentator <br />
named the Mayilainathar.<br />
<br />
This reference to "Palanthivukal" is found in a group of regional <br />
names given in "Akaththiyar Vaakku" as the other countries where <br />
Tamil was spoken, which is as follows:<br />
<br />
"Kanni then karai ka(da)t Palan thivam, Singalam, Kollam..palaku <br />
Thamil thiri nilangalum mudiyudai moovarum idu nila aatchi"<br />
<br />
Nannol  Page 272 Mayilainather Urai - U.V.Saminatha Iyer Publication <br />
(Also refer Tholkaappiam  Sollathikaram, Theiva Sillaiyar <br />
commentry)  <br />
<br />
From: the above it is noted that the approximate location of <br />
Palanthivukal was in the south of the Kanni the region of <br />
Kanyakumari, of TamilNadu State, South India.  <br />
<br />
The exact location of these Palanthivukal could be further gleaned <br />
from the writings of a Portugese Traveller named "Duarte Barbosa" of <br />
the early `seventeenth century' to the Indian Archipelago.<br />
<br />
"Opposite this country of Malabar, forty leagues to the west in the <br />
sea there is an archipelago of isles which the Indians say amount to <br />
twelve thousand, and they begin in front of mountain Dely and extend <br />
southwards. The first are four small flat islands which are called <br />
Malandiva, they are inhabited by Malabar Moors and they say that they <br />
are from the kingdom of Cananor............Over against Panam, <br />
Cochin, and Coulam to the west and south-west at a distance of <br />
seventy-five leagues are other islands of which ten or twelve are <br />
inhabited by Moors, brown and small in stature who have a separate <br />
language and a Moorish king who resides in an island called Mahaldi(v)<br />
u. And they call all these islands Palandiva..........Leaving these <br />
islands of Mahaldiva further on towards the east where the cape of <br />
Comoary......."<br />
<br />
A Description of the coasts of East Africa and Malabar - by Duarte <br />
Barbosa, page 164 & 166<br />
<br />
From: the above it is very clear the present Maldive Islands and <br />
Laccadive Islands (Lakshadeevip) together were known as Palanthivukal <br />
to the Indians of the early days. It seems though these islands <br />
together would not had an exact count, the Indians from early days <br />
believed that there have been twelve thousand islands.<br />
<br />
But there could have been a good possibility of many more tiny <br />
inhabitable islets been in existence in the early days, but not as <br />
much as twelve thousand that could have existed during the time of <br />
Rajaraja and Rajendra Chola 990 years ago. Many of such small islets <br />
could have been possibly submerged into the sea and now left with the <br />
present number of Islets as it exists today - as groups of Maldive <br />
Islands and Laccadive Islands (Lakshadeevip). <br />
<br />
<br />
Conquer of Palathivukal by Rajaraja Chola  1:   <br />
<br />
In two inscriptions of the 29th year of Rajaraja Chola - 1 on the <br />
walls of Thanjavur Great Temple,<br />
we note that there is no mention of Palanthivukal among the list of <br />
countries conquered by him.<br />
<br />
However in two other subsequent inscriptions of the same 29th year in <br />
the same temple, we note the Palanthivukal has been included in the <br />
list.<br />
<br />
Hence it is very clear that in the mid of 29th year of Rajaraja's <br />
rule the Cholas captured the Palanthivukal, that is in the year (985 <br />
+ 29) = A.D.1014 almost towards the end of his reign.<br />
<br />
The principal reason for capture of these small group of Islets, many <br />
of which are inhabitable and with less useful vegetations that could <br />
be grown there, could have been that there lived the Sea Priates in <br />
these islands who would have been a great hinderence to the Sea <br />
Traders from Kerala state and Tamil Nadu state which formed parts of <br />
the then Chola Empire, from moving around freely in the Indian Ocean <br />
with their trading activities.<br />
<br />
This would have made Rajaraja Chola to think that it was necessary to <br />
capture these Islands too and bring them under the Chola fold, even <br />
at the tail end of his rule.<br />
<br />
Or may be that Rajaraja Chola himself would have felt, that without <br />
conquering also these vast number of small Islets close to his <br />
mainland empire, that his imperialistic adventures would not be <br />
complete.    <br />
<br />
<br />
Conquer of Palanthivukal by Rajendra Chola - 1:  <br />
<br />
From: the inscriptions of Rajendra Chola  1, we note many of his 6th <br />
year inscriptions speak of the capture of Palanthivukal as the last <br />
in the list of countries found in his Meikeerthi. We also come across <br />
an inscription of his 5th year which too mentions his capture of the <br />
Palanthivukal as the last. Hence it is very clear this event would <br />
have taken place in the very latter part of his 5th year that is in <br />
(1012 +5 ) = A.D.1017.<br />
<br />
Rajendra Chola - 1 after ascending the throne would have found it <br />
necessary to send another expedition to the Palanthivukal to firmly <br />
establish their hold on these islands.<br />
<br />
There "could have been a possibility" that he appointed and left one <br />
of his generals with some forces in the principal island among this <br />
group of islands, whose generation over a period of time would have <br />
become the sole rulers of these islands.    <br />
<br />
This could have been also the possible reason the "copper plates <br />
grant' (known as `Lomafanu' in Maldivian language and as `Sasanam' in <br />
Sanskrit) issued in A.D.1196-97 in the "Haddummati Atol" (an Island <br />
among the group of modern Maldive Islands), nearly 190 years later<br />
after Rajendra's conquest, starts the narration with the <br />
words "Swasti Sri" as it was prevalent in Meikeerthis of the Chola <br />
kings of that Period. <br />
<br />
The list of names of the rulers of the island found in these plates <br />
are as follows which shows much of South Indian influence. The names <br />
are,<br />
<br />
(1) Sri Marhabarana<br />
(2) Svasti Sri Buvana Aditya<br />
(3) Svasti Sri Buvanabarana<br />
(4) Svasti Sri Darmmananda<br />
(5) Svasti Sri Srimat Somanga<br />
<br />
Yet another set of plates from "Bodugala Miskit of Male Atol" <br />
(another Island among the group of modern Maldive Islands) issued in <br />
A.D.1356-57 too has further names of it's rulers, also having Indian <br />
influence. But among them the most interesting one is the name which <br />
reads as,<br />
<br />
"Sri Ra-aradesvara"<br />
Could this have been a corruption of Rajarajeswara over a period of <br />
approximately 350 years ???<br />
<br />
All above rferences are from the book titled "The Maldive Islands - <br />
Monograph on History & Archaelogy by H.C.P.Bell  Pages 179-186 <br />
<br />
However we do need "more evidence" to prove positively, that these <br />
kings were the decendents of "a possible General or Chieftain who <br />
would have been placed to be in charge" of these islands by Rajendra <br />
Chola.<br />
<br />
Mr Clarence Maloney in his book titled "People of the Maldive <br />
Islands" (Page 107/8) has made the following statements which too are <br />
noteworthy.<br />
<br />
(1) "the Divehi (the Maldivian language) word for trader <br />
is "Soliya", and many foreign ports of call are known in Divehi by <br />
their Tamil names.<br />
<br />
(2) "Influence of medieval Tamil traders on the Maldives can be <br />
seen in most of the Divehi words for trade, and many words for items <br />
traded . Words for bundle, to sell, trade, steel, and cloves, and <br />
navigation terms such as pilot and compass are of Tamil origin. C(h)<br />
ola coins "kasu" which were standard in Sri Lanka and much of South <br />
India, have been found in the Maldives too. <br />
<br />
We also have another interesting account on a king of Maldive <br />
Islands, in the Sri Lankan Pali chronicle named Culavamsa (Wilhelm <br />
Geiger's Translation  Part 1, Page 228) from which we note "few <br />
years after the death of king Vijayabahu  1{A.D.1059-1114} of Sri <br />
Lanka", during the parallel period when Kuloththunga Chola  1<br />
(A.D.1070-1118) was ruling in South India, a warrior lord of the <br />
Ariya country by the name "Viradeva" who was the sole sovereign <br />
of "Palandipa" (Palanthivukal) invaded Sri Lanka and pursued after <br />
its new ruler Vikkramabahu  2 for his capture and for his kingdom. <br />
However after Viradeva's initial success, he was finally defeated and <br />
killed by Vikkramabahu.<br />
<br />
From: the above reference it is clear even to Sri Lankans of that <br />
period the Maldive Islands were known as "Palandipa".  <br />
<br />
Further we note, in the year A.D.1070 Kuloththunga Chola  1 became <br />
the next successor to the Chola Empire. However he lost the northern <br />
part of Sri Lanka in A.D.1088 which he never attempted to regain. <br />
<br />
"May be" the warrior lord "Viradeva" referred above who was the sole <br />
sovereign of Palandipa was a "decendent" of a possible Chola general <br />
who was placed in Palandipa during the period of Rajendra Chola, and <br />
who with the death of Kuloththunga Chola - 1 in A.D.1118 and becoming <br />
independent free of Chola control on Palanthivukal, and with the <br />
death of Vijayabahu  1 in A.D.1114 and turmoil following same in Sri <br />
Lanka would have thought of capturing this island for himself, and <br />
could have possibly made this expedition. <br />
<br />
However "the above inferences needs further evidences" to prove them <br />
positively.<br />
