    <p>--- Hi friends Yes I also have the same feeling about manimegalai's <br />
love. Kundavai is not ready to even know about his status when he <br />
was arrested for <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>death. After <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RRC</acronym> remembers him only she opens <br />
her mouth. she feel it to be bad to open that topic because of her <br />
status as a princess. But manimegalai also a princess of kadambur. <br />
She s ready sacrifice her status of being a Queen. If she is ready <br />
to marry <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>or madurandhagaer she will be the queen of chola <br />
kingdom . But she ios not willing for that even without knowing that <br />
whether <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> is loving her or not. And nandhini's love towards <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> is <br />
of selfishness. So compared to these ladies manimegalai's love is <br />
far far greater. And finally she became a pichi and loses her life <br />
in the thought of <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VT</acronym> itself. A true love should be like that. <br />

    hi friends,<br />
    i feel that manimegalai's love for vanthiya thevan is greater <br />
  than anyone's love .. she was ready to scarifice anything for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym>.. <br />
  without seeing <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> she started loving him.. the heart mainmegalai <br />
is <br />
  greatly portrayed by kalki...<br />
    she was even ready to accept that she killed <acronym title="Adithya Karikalan">AK </acronym>when vanthiya <br />
  thevan was blamed... while kunthavi dint even go and see <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> in <br />
  prison...<br />
    at any instance we cant say that love of kunthavai is greater <br />
  than manimegalai's..... kunthavai's love is full expectations...<br />
    but mainmegalai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VV</acronym> is a true love without any <br />
  expectations..<br />
    a love should be like that.... i think u ppl must 've come <br />
  accrosed the qoute in tamil "NEE ENAI KATHALITHALUM <br />
  KATHILIKAVITTALUM NAAN UNNAI KATHALIPEAN".. so i feel that <br />
  mainimegalai's love is greatest..<br />

    Question <br />
    <br />
    1) Is the Chola King name specified in the inscription ?<br />
    2) Who wrote it and why - meaning people write about their <br />
    achievement understandable, but do people write about their <br />
defeat <br />
    or suffering to be displayed.<br />
    The intent is very important.<br />
    <br />
    i dont have the actual epigraphica india volume ( think volume <br />

    Hi --<br />
    <br />
    * Kundhavai's Love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />
    <br />
    Kundhaivai's love is more of the kind where she was conscious of <br />
    what she was giving and what she was getting. But as a princess, <br />
  she <br />
    has to be. When taking kundhavai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to <br />
consider <br />
  a <br />
    lot of things. A princess of a big kingdom, who has been brought <br />
  up <br />
    in such a set up, actually,<br />
    falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If <br />
you <br />
    look at the way she responds to people, she actually nurtures <br />
and <br />
    helps the love to grow between the two. Her spontaneity could be <br />
    because, she wanted to be in Chozha nadu and by falling in love <br />
  with <br />
    a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn't<br />
    have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th <br />
    bagam if I am right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above <br />
  anything <br />
    else in her life. She knows what she wants, what she is capable <br />
of <br />
    giving and for that what she can expect in return. She is pretty <br />
    clear. <br />
    <br />
    * Vanathi's love for AM<br />
    <br />
    She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have <br />
to <br />
    keep that in mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her <br />
love <br />
    and she takes a wow that she will not sit on the throne as his <br />
  patta <br />
    magishi(pm). As Ram aptly puts it, the wow was to silence people <br />
    like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />
    harping that she loves AM to be his pm. <br />
    <br />
    * Manimekalai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />
    <br />
    As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls <br />
in <br />
    love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, <br />
  she <br />
    loves her brother so much and this friendship between them (<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> <br />
and <br />
    her brother) has been instrumental for the love to blossom. In <br />
the <br />
    end too, its because she<br />
    realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is <br />
wrong <br />
    that she goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux <br />
  situation <br />
    where she loves this guy but is unable to accept for her brother <br />
  is <br />
    giving a conflicting version and then she realizes something <br />
else. <br />
    And in the end, everything<br />
    goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its <br />
    fate that plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do <br />
  with <br />
    the love she has for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has <br />
    done harm to her brother, I doubt she would have acted the way <br />
she <br />
    did. That's not in her character. <br />
    <br />
    * Nandini's love for KK<br />
    <br />
    Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic <br />
example <br />
    of leaf who is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she <br />
wants <br />
    as and when she wants to just satisfy her whims and fancies of <br />
  that <br />
    moment. I doubt if she herself knows what she wants. She is not <br />
    clear. All she wants is power. In<br />
    the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> <br />
    seeing how strong his will is, but in the process somewhere she <br />
  does <br />
    fall for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. But in the end she ends up using this guy too as a <br />
    scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a lot of respect and <br />
    reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />
    again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people <br />
    including Ravidasan. <br />
    <br />
    * Mandhakini's love for SC<br />
    <br />
    She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost <br />
  his <br />
    way. So all she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And <br />
that's <br />
    another love at first sight, which happened, when she tried <br />
saving <br />
    this guy from a bear. She is an exceptional person who loses <br />
  memory <br />
    of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />
    around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and <br />
    disappointment in life. But her love for one man in her life is <br />
    predominant above everything else. She lives for SC. She has no <br />
  life <br />
    of herself. She keeps roaming around SC and his life and by her <br />
    extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />
    time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life <br />
  in <br />
    the process of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary <br />
    character who cant be compared to anyone else in the novel. Not <br />
  can <br />
    you compare her love with anyone's for as I said, she did not <br />
live <br />
    her life for herself. Her life was<br />
    dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him. <br />
    <br />
    * Poonguzhali's love for AM<br />
    <br />
    This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She <br />
  realized <br />
    that there was no point in going ahead with something that would <br />
    never get fulfilled. Instead, she realized that its better to <br />
    acknowledge the love that Sendhan Amudhan was showering on her. <br />
  And <br />
    that was a wise decision both for<br />
    herself and for AM. <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would <br />
say <br />
    it was Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. <br />
And <br />
    she died in the process of saving his life. <br />
    <br />
    But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give <br />
    (she too has plans for her life) and she is deciding things <br />
    accordingly and handling things accordingly. Here this woman is <br />
an <br />
    individual by herself and is clear in what she wants and what <br />
she <br />
    can give. She is not interested in going<br />
    about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste <br />
  her <br />
    time on it. I would say its being more intelligent to make ones <br />
  own <br />
    life happy rather than creating unhappiness for you and for your <br />
    beloved. That way, I would rate Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai <br />
    second. <br />
    <br />
    I don't know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain <br />
  Head <br />
    by Any Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at <br />
a <br />
    particular place, that unless you know the meaning of 'I' in 'I <br />
  love <br />
    you' you cannot understand what it actually means to love <br />
another <br />
    person. That way, I feel both<br />
    Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the 'I' well and <br />
    emphatically. <br />
    <br />
    To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and <br />
  both <br />
    you and your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that <br />
love. <br />
    That way I feel the only sensible women of the novel were <br />
    Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. And both do not expect anything in <br />
  return <br />
    for their love. They are happy and<br />
    they make their loved ones happy too. <br />
    <br />
    My 5 cents <img src='/img/common/smileys/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='smiley' /> <br />
    <br />
    thanks,<br />
    Vidya. <br />
