<br />

<p>Speaking about Mathuranthaka - we should make a clear cut distinction between historical Mathuranthaka Uttama Chozha and the Senthan amudhan -turnedmathuranthaka of <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>. Senthan amudhan is a fictional character - personification of soft hearted men of great character and ideals. He is also human and down to earth - he says he will prefer poonguzhali over sivabhakthi loka <img src='/img/common/smileys/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='smiley' /> .</p>

<p>But I'm not here to discuss Senthan amudhan in detail. My interest is with Mathuranthaka Uttama Chola - as history portrays him and the facts that go with or contradict what is said in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> about that guy.</p>

<p>First and foremost point of interest (this, I've mentioned in another mail as well) - is that initially senthan amudhan was not intented to be converted to Mathuranthaka by</p>
<p>Kalki. The reasons for this sudden change of mind on Kalki's side - in itself - is a point of great debate. But I'll not go into it.</p>

<p>All I'd like to say here is the exact incident as portrayed by Kalki's son Mr.Rajendran : </p>
<p>One day Kalki was doing Yogasana - every morning he had the habit of doing that. (Remember that Yogacharya Sundaram's widely acclaimed series on Yoga featured as a series in Kalki - in those days.) And it was boy Rajendran's duty - every day - to count numbers for his father when he was doing Sirasasanam - a posture of standing upside down !</p>

<p>On the given day - after recovering from asana posture - Kalki suddenly asked the boy : Senthan Amudhanaye Raja Aaki vittal enna ? (Why not make Sendhan Amudhan a king ?)</p>

<p>Of course, Kalki should have thought about this afterwords also - before coming to a conclusion. But in my own humble opinion, the historical mathuranthaka looks more like the earlier mathuranthaka than the pious Senthan amudhan ! </p>

<p>Any evidences ? Well, I have more than one !. Let us see the historic evidences that stand for and against the theory that Mathuranthaka indeed conspired to kill Aditya. To do this effectively, we need to look at what happened AFTER aditya's killing as well as the reign of Uttama chola as a whole.</p>

<h5>Evidence 1 :</h5>
<p>The very first evidence that throws some light into this is the Thiruvalangadu plates. They say pretty clearly that the country men wanted to bring Arumozhi as the next prince but Arumozhi declined - saying that AS LONG AS HIS STEP FATHER UTTAMA CHOZHA WISHES - HE WILL NOT CONSIDER - EVEN MENTALLY ABOUT SUCEEDING THE CHOZHA THRONE.</p>

<p>You can view this in different angles. One view - taken by T.V.Sadasiva pandarathar - a noted historian - is that Arumozhi had so much respect in his step father that he procalimed this statment. </p>

<p>If you read Kalki's conclusion to <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> - you will understand that the whole story is based on this sacrifice of Arumozhi and that is why Part 5 is aptly named THIYAGA CHIGARAM (Pinnacle of sacrifice). Thus, Kalki has accepted T.V.P's conclusions as a whole.</p>

<p>But there is also another angle - which we can consider. The most important thing that is visible from Thiruvalangadu inscriptions is that UTTAMA DID WISH FOR THE THRONE. Thus, in order to avoid a serious domestic conflict - Arumozhi decided to give room for his step father's wishes. It is absolutely possible that the power camps were divided in this issue - as <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> succintly portrays - and since the overall chola empire was under the threat of disintegration - Arumozhi gave way for Uttama and decided to move his coins cauciously - as Uttama did.</p>

<p>From what I've written sofar - you should have got my opinion : That arumozhi had his own plans in giving up the chola throne tentatively -in the light of domestic confusions and the death of crown prince.</p>

<p>I'll try to substantiate this as we go along.</p>

<h5>Evidence 2 :</h5>

<p>Pandyas had been the sworne enemies of cholas since time immemorial. </p>

<p>We are all aware that bitter battles were faught between the two throughout the later hola regime. Vijayala / Aditya, Paranthaka, Gandaradhitya (?) - and ofcourse, Paranthaka II (Sundara chola) - all had to fight Pandya revolt at some point of their time. Infact Paranthaka had to fight more than once - to supress Pandya king veerapandiya.</p>

<p>One such war was faught in sevur - in which veera pandiyan lost his life. If you go a <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> further - you'll find that Rajaraja the great began his historic conquest first from Pandya country (though Kandalur salai battle with cheras is considered the first - Rajarja had to first cross the pandya empire even to reach Kandhalur. Thus, he had to supress Amarabhujanga, the then pandyan emperor - before proceeding to chera country).</p>

<p>My simple question is : WHY THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO PANDYA REVOLT DURING UTTAMA'S TIME - FOR 15 LONG YEARS?</p>

<p>It is evident that Pandyas were alive and well during this period - because Rajaraja's first battle with them and subsequent battles with cheras (in which Pandyas obviously alighned with cheras to overcome chola power) - were neverthless easy victories. Thus we cannot say that Pandyas were too weak to plan any revolt in this period.</p>

<h5>Evidence 3 :</h5>

<p>By right, history should have seen a chola - pandya fight very close to Aditya chola's death. The confution that was prevailing in chola empire was obvious - there were confusions as to who might be the successor and it was a very good time for pandya's to capitalize this. But they did'nt.</p>

<p>One arguement could be that there were no pandya emperors in the meanwhile. But this is strange - considering the way Pandyas organised themselves. Because, Pandya's called themselves as descendents of Pancha Pandavas and to make people believe this - more than one ruler was available at any point of time. Ofcourse, they all had a supreme leader among themselves - who was called the emperor - but the important thing is there were always some royal guys to replace a leader. There are many many evidences available to prove this - it is difficult for me to detail them here.</p>

<p>The overall point implied here is that Pandyas might have had their own leader who replaced Veerapandya - probably the Amarabhujanga ! - when Aditya was killed.There was a 3 year gap between Sevur Battle and Aditya's death - a sufficiently long gap for the pandyas to identify their next leader.</p>

<p>To me, these evidences do tell something...some dark and secret story, long buried in the recesses of time .....how about you ?</p>

<h5>Evidence 4 :</h5>

<p>It is quite interesting to note that Mathuranthaka either had no issues or had some issues who could not come to power. T.V.S. Pandarathar talks about certain 'Mathuranthaka" who was working as a temple supervisor in Rajaraja's times and says that he was the son of Uttama chola. I'm not sure whether his claim was based on any evidences or not. Remember that even Rajendra had the name madhuranthaka before he became a king.</p>

<p>Arumizhi was recognised as the heir apparent during uttama's time. If uttama had children, they should have come to power either during his own life time or after Rajaraja. But surprisingly, we find that issues of Utttama chola are not even tracable very clearly - leave alone the issue of coming to power.</p>

<p>It is difficult to accept that theory that Uttama did'nt have any children - considering the fact that he had many wives - unless....(You know what I mean <img src='/img/common/smileys/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='smiley' /> )</p>

<p>Taking TVS theory that he had a son, why was he not given a very high position or recognized in Rajaraja's times ? What happened to the generations that followed ? At a much later date, we find that a completely new breed of cholas (chalukya - cholas) were allowed to regin the kingdom after athi rajendra. It is quite surprising that the issues of Uttama chola could not make a headway into the royal frontiers at all.</p>

<p>It somehow seems that the whole generation was disregarded - in terms of power - since Rajaraja. Why did the generation did not revolt ? After all, going by the chola practice - the crown belongs to the generation of uttama more than arumozhi. </p>

<p>Was it true that Rajaraja and Rajendra completely overshadowed the other branch by their sheer valour ? Or was it a deliberate attempt to sideline the generation of Uttama who committed a henious crime to sieze the throne ?</p>
