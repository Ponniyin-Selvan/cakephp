    <p>Hello friends,<br />
I thank venkatesh sir and Vijayakumar sir for boosting me on my first post.Thanks for sridhar sir to greet the newcomers and renewing the topic as we are unfortunate to participate in the old discussion.<br />
Of course it is impossible to estimate love.but it is the situations and the acting of the concerned persons, gives evidence to others to comment on their love.but analyzing is the must before commenting.isn't it?<br />
As i viewed this collection given by sridhar sir, i travel in some of the paths of srividhya mam.yes.Kundavai is not like all the other princess who are brought up with silver spoon and spend their time in dance,music,temples and other luxurious activities.she is involving herself in the "arasiyal soodharangam".so in that game she cannot expose her feelings openly and certainly must not do so.not only she exposed her feelings but also she controlled her feelings.<br />
"ilaiyapiraati mattum pennai pirakkaamal aanaai piranthirunthal intha ulagam muzhuvathaiyum arasaandiruppaal"lines of aniruthar proves her ability.when vanthiyathevan was in sirai after the clash with pinaagabaani before tha pazhaiyaarai palace she didnt rushed.instead intelligently she argued with aniruthar and got release agreement with a work for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> that he should stop aditha karikaalar from going to kadambur.<br />
<br />
In this she succeeded in her love also (remember she reveals her love int his par and released him).at the same time no one can comment over her that for her love alone she went jail and released <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.if any comment rises there is enough answer for that.she acts so wisely.oru poruppaana ilavarasi ikkattaana samayangalil than unarchihalai parakka vitaal athu arivudaimaiyaagumaa?apadi porumaiyaai irupathai selfishness nu solla mudiyumaa?after adithan's padukolai she was sad for that "blood is thicker than water".yet she controlled her feelings for the welfare of the country.(she started to think over the riots that are going to break)<br />
From nandipurathu naayagi by vikraman,when vanthi was put in jail as an accused of adithan's kolai she did nothing but remained in nandipuram unmarried.avalukku chozha nattin mel mattum kaadhal irunthirunthaal aval angeye paarthiyai mananthu irunthirukalaame.aanaal en seiyyavilaai endraal vanthi mel avalukku kaadhal irunthathu.allathu sundara chozharukku nalla oru veermullavanaai thahudhiullavanaai tham padaiyileye paarthu avanukku oru uyarntha padhavi koduthu kundavai ku marriage panni vaithirukka theriyaatha?instead when paarthi asked permission to marry kundavai sundarar told him that it depends upon kundavai's wish.(knowing her love on vanthi)<br />
<br />
Also kundavai tells in fifth part to amv that she is so kind to him because his horoscopes tell that he will rise tha status of chozha empire.suppose if it is not so,she would not have hated avm.rather she might have changed her directions this shows her patriotism.<br />
also she tries to marry amv to vanathi because of her horoscope's sayings that her son will be a chakravarthi.intha horoscope veru oru ilavarasikku irunthirunthaal avalaithaan thambikku thirumanam seivithirupaal even if vanathi had loved amv.<br />
<br />
She is a leader.not a dictator. under each situation the reason for her stoneliness is "chozhanaatin menmai" only.one cannot tell this as selfishness.remember gandhi's quote "oru kudumbathin menmaikaaga oru nabarai izhakkalaam,oru gramathin menmaikaaga oru oorai thiyaagam seyyalaam....................."athu pola thaan she controlled the feelings of herself,arulmozhi(remember while proposing her love kundavai remarks about amvl "avan ulahamaala piranthavan athanaal avan nenchukkum thaazhida virumbinen"),adithan by preventing him by meeting nandini,etc.<br />
Raja kudumbathinar sugabohamaaga vaazhvathillai.thangal manam pol nadakka avarhalukku vazhiyillai.avarhaludaiya ovoru asaivum naatin thalaivithi.if their son or the king dies in war the queen should not cry.then only she is veerapathini(think of parthiban 's kootru to arulmozhirani)<br />
in yavana raani by chaandilyan irumbidarthalaiyar speaks to karikaalchozhan((thirumaavalavan) under a situation ,"naadaala piranthvanukku unarchihal kattil irukka vendum,karikaala"(sorry i searched for the link but not available)<br />
Ithai nandraaga purinthu kondu kundavai seyalpattaal.oru raja kudumbam unarchihalai adakki irupathaalthaan naatu makkal nimmathiyaaga irukka mudihirathu.aanaal athu veliyil paarkum pothu athu suyanalamaaga aha theriyum.<br />
Suppose if kundavai loves and goes with vanthi without caring anything.what might have happened?unimaginable.not only kundavai,but narasimhar (<acronym title="Sivakamiyin Sabatham">SS</acronym>),and somany kings and ilavarasis their hearts might be tied with strong and heavy belt. may be unknown to us.avanga apdi irunthathaal thaan naam ippadi irukka mudihirathu.<br />
At this point i want to quote billgates sayings,<br />
"Behind the success of every person,there is an untold pain in the heart"(some of the words may be wrong but the concept is this)<br />
<br />
<br />
And sridhar sir,i want to tell the greatness of kundavai's love towards vanthi from your words.you told that she cried only in very few circumstances.among that circumstances the scene where she proposes her love to vanthi is also one.<br />
"vanthiyathevan sollizhanthu seyalizhanthu KUNDAVAIYIN KANNEER THATHUMBIYA KANGALAI paartha vannam madhiyum izhanthu nindraan"<br />
are the last lines of muppathaam athiyaayam (IRU SIRAIHAL)in third paagam.words................................<br />
<br />
Prachanaihal ,ulnaatu sadhi,vetru mannarin aabathuthavihal pondra tharkaala prachanihal,chozha naatin pirkaala menmai ,lover is in jail without doing any wrong and her inability to meet him,,brother who is going to be the future king is in overseas,in this kind of situation haste makes waste.atlast firmly stepping beyond all the obstacles she married vallavaraiyan vanthiyathevan.doesn't this seems true and bold love?<br />
but Oruvelai vanthiyathevanukku ethaavathu ahi irunthaalum kundavai might have remained with the same boldness and courage but unmarried reminding of her love.she can be called as an emblem of boldness.<br />
<br />
And MANIMEKALAI,she is an innocent child.she knows nothing other than vanthiyathevan.sambuvaraiyar sellam koduthu valartha manimekalai ,kadaisiyil oor ooraaha thirinthu kadaisiyil kundavaiyin maalihai vaasalil vanthu adithanai naan thaan kondren endru alaruhiraal.pichiyai pol odi nadhiyil vizhuhiraal.iruthiyaaha avanai ninaithe uyiraium viduhiraal.oru azhagaana malar poothu vehu viraivileya uthirnthu vittathu.-kalki<br />

<br />
Vanathi's love for Arunmozhi...which was ready to forsake the throne<br />

<br />
That is an interesting question:-))<br />
<br />
Although all the 5 love u had mentioned are great I would rate<br />
Mandhaagini's love as the greatest.<br />
<br />
1.Kundavai might have preferred <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> over others precisely for the<br />
reason that he was a 'nAdOdi" so that she can be in Chozha nAdu<br />
and "aatti-padaiththufy the country"<br />
<br />
2.vAnathy's decision was mainly to silence the people who were<br />
telling that she is after Arulmozhi to become the pattamagishi.<br />
<br />
3.Poonkuzhali dint expect nething from Arulmozhi but when u<br />
compare her with Mandagini who even after being "vanjithufied" by<br />
Sundarachozhar gave her life to save him and saved his son for<br />
quiete a few times.<br />
<br />
4.Manimekalai will get the second place in my rating...she was<br />
ready to give her life for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> but I doubt whether she wud have<br />
done the same thing had <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> cheated her.<br />
<br />
Just my '2 cents'<br />
<br />
hope to hear more,<br />

<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
Good that the discussion has been restarted after a<br />
little long break and also with an interesting<br />
topic!!!!<br />
<br />
I presumed that Kundavai's love towards <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is merely a<br />
selfish sort of.. While reading I felt all through the<br />
novel she has been somehow dominating and selfish.<br />
<br />
Poonguzhali's towards Arulmozhi: I didn't feel like<br />
poonguzhali really loved him. I felt it is some sort<br />
of likings when u see/know a goodie goodie guy..<br />
<br />
Nandhini's towards karikalan: We can say this also a<br />
selfish love. When she knows that she won't be able to<br />
get him, she dint care abt his feelings..Some sort of<br />
"You are not going to be mine, then why should I care<br />
about!!!!"<br />
<br />
Vanadhi's towards Arulmozhi and Manimekalai's towards<br />
VD: Oru mathiri saathvigamana amaidhiyana anbu..<br />
<br />
Generally positions and throne and all won't matter<br />
much if u r loved and going to be together with your<br />
beloved ones. Here if vanadhi has been given<br />
pattamagishi or not, it wudn't impact much since<br />
anyway she is going to be with Arulmozhi and I thought<br />
that she has sacrificed but not much as compared to<br />
Mandhahini and Manimegalai.<br />
<br />
Yeah.. I do agree with Ram that Mandhahini's is<br />
selfless and great. But still eventhough she hadn't<br />
been living with Sundara Chola throughout her lifetime<br />
atleast she had been with him for somedays, loved him<br />
and been loved by him. For that love, she cud have<br />
sacrificed and saved Sudara and his son.<br />
<br />
But in case of Manimegalai, she has been really<br />
selfless to sacrifice even her life for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> not knowing<br />
for sure whether he loves her or not..<br />
<br />
Manimegalai tops the rating!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />
Sathya<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Ram and Sathya..<br />
<br />
That was interesting..i agree with you..Manthagini and Manimegalai in that order.Manthagini inspite of her being wronged still does everything for her beloved..Kalki really potrays her true love so well...especially in the scenes where she dots around Arun mozhi varman.....<br />
<br />
No wonder they immortalised her by making her a Goddess even today there is a Temple for the SingalaNachi Amman in Thanjavur OFF Medical College road which allegedly was built for Mandhakini by Arunmozhi....<br />
<br />
Manimegalai had all the sweet innocence and sacrifices everything for her love..well whether manimegalai would have loved Vandhiyadevan inspite of his betrayal...Mm well she knows he didnt love her and used her with his seettalk to get near Karikalan she forgives him and loves him so I m sure She would have done the same...True love always does it.<br />
<br />
Nandhini...well did she really love one person atleast truely...that's the question which Kalki leaves us with..but she constantly does keep reminding Karikalan of her love..even before his death..<br />
<br />
Kunthavai..the potrayal of her charecter is so high that she never reveals her love or mental urmaoil..Infact in the whole series there would be tears in her eyes only on a few occasions...<br />
<br />
Vanathi what starts as an innocent love later becomes mature....she even dares to attain gajendra motcham for Arunmozhi..<br />
<br />
Pongulali...well it aws just a sort of Infactuation...crush sort of thing..<br />
<br />
The importnat tHing about Kalki is people and their attitute changes from Time to ..I found it hard to beleive as normal when I first read it in sixth standard(and hve read it almost every year during the final exams a great stress releiver) but as I have grown older.. Ive understood Kalkis charectors are mere mortals and they do change their mind and attitutes like all of us.<br />
<br />
BTW has any one checkedhttp://ponniyinselv.users3.50megs.com/What did you thing of it I found it interesting<br />
<br />
By for now<br />

<br />
<br />
Hi --<br />
<br />
* Kundhavai's Love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />
<br />
Kundhaivai's love is more of the kind where she was conscious of what she was<br />
giving and what she was getting. But as a princess, she has to be. When taking<br />
kundhavai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> we need to consider a lot of things. A princess of a<br />
big kingdom, who has been brought up in such a set up, actually,<br />
falls in love at first sight, not knowing who this guy is. If you look at the<br />
way she responds to people, she actually nurtures and helps the love to grow<br />
between the two. Her spontaneity could be because, she wanted to be in Chozha<br />
nadu and by falling in love with a vagabond like <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>, she needn't<br />
have to leave Chozha nadu. She in fact says somewhere in the 4th bagam if I am<br />
right in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> that she loves Chozha nadu above anything else in her life. She<br />
knows what she wants, what she is capable of giving and for that what she can<br />
expect in return. She is pretty clear.<br />
<br />
* Vanathi's love for AM<br />
<br />
She falls in love with an aanai paagan and not with AM. We have to keep that in<br />
mind. She is ready to go to any extreme for her love and she takes a wow that<br />
she will not sit on the throne as his patta magishi(pm). As Ram aptly puts it,<br />
the wow was to silence people like Poonguzhali, who kept<br />
harping that she loves AM to be his pm.<br />
<br />
* Manimekalai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />
<br />
As for Manimekalai, she is completely lost. She actually falls in love with <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym><br />
from what her brother tells her about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. Its like, she loves her brother so<br />
much and this friendship between them (<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> and her brother) has been<br />
instrumental for the love to blossom. In the end too, its because she<br />
realizes that all that her brother had projected about <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is wrong that she<br />
goes head strong in saving him. She is in a crux situation where she loves this<br />
guy but is unable to accept for her brother is giving a conflicting version and<br />
then she realizes something else. And in the end, everything<br />
goes hay way for this poor girl and she is thrown to pieces. Its fate that<br />
plays a very bad trick on her. That has nothing to do with the love she has for<br />
<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. If she were to be convinced that <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> has done harm to her brother, I doubt<br />
she would have acted the way she did. That's not in her character.<br />
<br />
* Nandini's love for KK<br />
<br />
Did she love anyone at all except herself? She is classic example of leaf who<br />
is tossed in the wind and takes up any shape she wants as and when she wants to<br />
just satisfy her whims and fancies of that moment. I doubt if she herself knows<br />
what she wants. She is not clear. All she wants is power. In<br />
the process as a kid, she used KK and then she tries using <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> seeing how strong<br />
his will is, but in the process somewhere she does fall for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>. But in the end<br />
she ends up using this guy too as a scape goat elsewhere. But she did have a<br />
lot of respect and reverence for Periya Pazhuvertrayar though<br />
again she did use him to exercise power on a lot of people including Ravidasan.<br />
<br />
* Mandhakini's love for SC<br />
<br />
She fell in love and married a guy who happened to be have lost his way. So all<br />
she knew was a sailor who has lost his way. And that's another love at first<br />
sight, which happened, when she tried saving this guy from a bear. She is an<br />
exceptional person who loses memory of her life for 2 years. Roams<br />
around Srilanka as a mad woman, with such a lot of grief and disappointment in<br />
life. But her love for one man in her life is predominant above everything<br />
else. She lives for SC. She has no life of herself. She keeps roaming around SC<br />
and his life and by her extra-ordinary perception saves AM many a<br />
time from some peril or the other and in the end, loses her life in the process<br />
of saving SC. She is certainly an extra-ordinary character who cant be compared<br />
to anyone else in the novel. Not can you compare her love with anyone's for as<br />
I said, she did not live her life for herself. Her life was<br />
dedicated to SC and she lived her life for him.<br />
<br />
* Poonguzhali's love for AM<br />
<br />
This is another beautiful love that did not live long. She realized that there<br />
was no point in going ahead with something that would never get fulfilled.<br />
Instead, she realized that its better to acknowledge the love that Sendhan<br />
Amudhan was showering on her. And that was a wise decision both for<br />
herself and for AM.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if we were to assess whose love was the greatest, we would say it was<br />
Mandakini for she gave her life for the man she loved. And she died in the<br />
process of saving his life.<br />
<br />
But I wish to look at it this way. Think of what a girl can give (she too has<br />
plans for her life) and she is deciding things accordingly and handling things<br />
accordingly. Here this woman is an individual by herself and is clear in what<br />
she wants and what she can give. She is not interested in going<br />
about for something that she knows may not bear fruit and waste her time on it.<br />
I would say its being more intelligent to make ones own life happy rather than<br />
creating unhappiness for you and for your beloved. That way, I would rate<br />
Poonguzhali first and Kundhavai second.<br />
<br />
I don't know how many of you have read a novel called Fountain Head by Any<br />
Rand. In that the protagonist Roark tells to his lover at a particular place,<br />
that unless you know the meaning of 'I' in 'I love you' you cannot understand<br />
what it actually means to love another person. That way, I feel both<br />
Poonguzhali and Kundhavai knew how to say the 'I' well and emphatically.<br />
<br />
To love is not to sacrifice. You should know yourself well and both you and<br />
your loved one should be happy as an outcome of that love. That way I feel the<br />
only sensible women of the novel were Poonguzhali and Kundhavai. And both do<br />
not expect anything in return for their love. They are happy and<br />
they make their loved ones happy too.<br />
<br />
My 5 cents <img src='/img/common/smileys/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='smiley' /> <br />

Bravo! That Poonghuzhali's love would be better than either Mandhakini's or<br />
Manimegalai's I'd not considered before. But its quite true- Poonghuzhali is<br />
such a sensible person, its exactly how she would react.<br />
<br />
By the way...I know Kalki has written about the Singala Naachiaar koil,<br />
built by Arulmozhi- but what's the truth behind it? Did Kalki cleverly use a<br />
decrepit temple to bring in Mandhakini's existence, or did it all happen<br />
like Kalki portrays in <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>...in a way, did Mandhakini really exist?<br />
<br />
And did Uthama Chozhar really marry a 'Odakkaara penn' ??<br />

You have mentioned only Female charecter's love in each of<br />
the case either beauty or diginity plays a major role.<br />
Even in the case of Manthagini, we all know that Sundara<br />
Cholan was the most handsome person during that period and<br />
being a Deaf & dum Manthagini's love towards him is to certain<br />
extent I would call as selfish.<br />
<br />
But "Senthan Amuthan's love towards Poonkuzhali is abosolutely a<br />
great one and divine one. We can realise this from the<br />
conversation in which Senthan Amuthan tried to express his<br />
love towards her.<br />

Pavithra...yes there is Singalanachiyar Koil in tanjore and the folklore say it was dedicated to a Eela Pen by RajaRaja Cholan...whether Kalki used his imagination...We I do't know But Remember Srilanka had ties with the Pandya kings only traditionall till the advent of Rajaraja chola and it was only in Rajendra Chola's time did they conquer the whole of Srilanka .hence it is odd that Rajaraja would dedicate a temple for a Srilankan women unless there was a significance.<br />

Hi all<br />
<br />
I consider the love of Manimegalai towards <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> is<br />
the greatest one in the novel.She fell in love before<br />
meeting him as she was impressed by his brothers<br />
words.Though she was princess she was willing to marry<br />
him.Her brothers opinon was entirely opposit when she<br />
happen to meet <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.But she didn't giveup her love.When<br />
her father and brother offered two chances to become<br />
pattamagishi of Chola kingdom by marrying either<br />
Athitha karikalan or Mathuranthagan she was not<br />
prepared to giveup her love towards <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.That selfless<br />
true love lasted in her heart till end of her life. I<br />
agree with sathya in this context<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hi<br />
Kundhavai's love for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>-it was a 'mature' love.She was<br />
greatly impressed by <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It was his 'character' that<br />
made her love him.He had all qualifications she<br />
expected like someone who would stay with in Chola<br />
empire..But She was not 'just a princess'.She was a<br />
very important person who was involved in<br />
administration,whose opnions were greatly valued.When<br />
<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> was imprisoned she could not cry like<br />
Manimekalai.She carefully handled the kingdom,the<br />
politics,her brother,her father and also her love.Her<br />
love was not 'the most important' in her view.Yet she<br />
wouldn't have loved anyone else too.<br />
So she was first a princess and then a lover.<br />
<br />
Poonkullai loved Arulmolli as people of chola kingdom<br />
did.It was not true love-she admired him,liked him but<br />
was not sure whether she wanted to live in a palace or<br />
not.She realised the true love of Senthan AMuthan and<br />
reciprocated to it.It was Senthan Amuthan's love that<br />
made her love him.So her love becomes a deeper one.<br />
<br />
Vanathi's love...she loved Arul Molli varmar and not<br />
Rajarajachola(i.e the king).Her love was love at first<br />
sight.She would do anything for Arulmozhivarmar.<br />
<br />
Nandhini's love for Karikalan...it's not true love.She<br />
wanted to be rich,to be a queen and that made her love<br />
him.It was clearly a love for purpose.<br />
<br />
Mandhahini and her father only lived in that<br />
island.Imagine Mandhahini alone in a island meets a<br />
handsome stranger who loves her even when he knows she<br />
is dumb.So naturally she loved him.Her life was filled<br />
with joy when she was with Sundara Chola.So he is the<br />
only one she loved forever.Her love had no bounds.It's<br />
well expressed in the story.She was a noble character.<br />
<br />
Manimekalai's love was blind.From the words of her<br />
brother she started loving <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.She really didn't know<br />
much about him.It was her imaginations that made her<br />
love him.Even it is her imagination the made her<br />
mentally disturbed in the end.So it was a mad love.<br />
<br />
Now which is better-a matured love,love at first<br />
sight,blind love,love for purpose,or love the extends<br />
to generations.<br />
Not only Mandhahini, Pooonguzhali & Vanathi would have<br />
sacrificed their lives for their love and would have<br />
shown kindness to their children.(I think so!)<br />
<br />
But there is onething-the love of Nandhini for <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.It<br />
is not insisted much.yet it made me think - Nandhini<br />
form her childhood wanted power & wealth and was<br />
making moves to get that.Yet she lost her heart to<br />
<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>.Her psoition was critical-she wanted to take<br />
revenge,restore Padyas to power,Kill Karikalan--yet<br />
she had a love which could never be expressed and<br />
which would never be accepted.But I know that there'll<br />
be contradictions whether she loved <acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym> or not.<br />
<br />
Among all I find love of Kundhavai & Nandhini to<br />
<acronym title="Vallavaraiyan Vandhiyathevan">VD</acronym>,because they considered love to be an important<br />
part of life-yet a part of life.It is the practical<br />
way too.<br />
<br />
Regarding changing the title-<acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is better.Even there<br />
came a 'thodar'in Kalki titled <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> which explained the<br />
life of Kalki.So kaliki is <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym>.I welcome discussions on<br />
other novels also.<br />
