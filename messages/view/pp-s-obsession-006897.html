but one thing is for sure .. i Know about Mylady's garden in chennai, behind mooremarket... which was a prominent place ... you can see lot of mylady's garden in B/W tamil movies......<br />

Dear Mr.Dhiwakar,<br />
I would beg to differ there too....but then this ain't the place to do that..<br />
So I will not...but one question....?<br />
Why no comment on "like Periya Pazhuvettayar being obsessed with Nandhini.....!!!!"<br />
Has not Nandhini taken Periya Pazhuvettayar for a ride.....like Milady did with so many in Three Musketeers?<br />

Dears,<br />
<br />
i think we are becoming too obsessed with Prabanchan and deviating from the purpose.....<br />
<br />
It is like Ravana being too obsessed with Rama , whereby he lost all his virtues and ultimately perished.......(pls do not start a thread as to whether is right to compare Rama with Prabanchan and us with Ravana)...<br />
<br />
by concentrating too much on prabanchan, we are losing our focus.....<br />
<br />
today, even a great Person like "Mahatma Gandhi" is not above Criticism.. so accept it as a way of life...<br />

Dear Vijay,<br />
<br />
I strongly believe that everybody has a right to his/her opinions. We can't say Prapancham was wrong in having his opinions. We can disagree with his opinions.. and I do.. I believe his opinion is wrong (that is my own view of course) but at the same time I also believe he has every right to his opinion. Who was it who said that "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"? Or words to that effect..<br />
<br />
I thought it was Voltaire.. but a little <acronym title="Birla Institute of Technology">BIT</acronym> of Googling got me this :<br />
<br />
This eloquent defense of tolerance and freedom of speech is widely attributed to the French writer Voltaire, that master of liberal philosophy renowned for his satirical wit. François-Marie Arouet ( Voltaire was his nom de plume) was one of the most celebrated writers of the 18th-century intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment. His tolerant religious and political beliefs were in sharp opposition to established views, and his biting commentaries twice led to his imprisonment, and eventually, to his exile to England.<br />
But the fact of the matter is, Voltaire didn't pen or utter the sentiment you quote. According to a number of web sites, "The phrase was invented by a later author as an epitome of his attitude." It comes from The Friends of Voltaire, written by Evelyn Beatrice Hall and published in 1906 under the pseudonym Stephen G. Tallentyre. Hall said that she paraphrased Voltaire's words in his "Treatise on Toleration," which includes such thoughts as:<br />
Not only is it extremely cruel to persecute in this brief life those who do not think the way we do, but I do not know if it might be too presumptuous to declare their eternal damnation.Regards,<br />

<br />
Prabanchan has the right to put his views but he<br />
shouldn't have saying "not considered <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is not<br />
historic novel" when <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is completely based on<br />
historic facts. He would have told about "Parthipan<br />
Kanavu". I think Prabanchan confused between "Ponniyin<br />
Selvan" and "Parthipan Kanavu".<br />
<br />
Anyway if you tell about eveybody have the right to<br />
disagree means its bad that someone who professional<br />
writer disagreed on Tirukkural may not be correct.<br />
<br />
Like Prabanchan somebody disagree with Tirukkural, it<br />
doesn't make any sense. He may tell that even if whole<br />
world accept Tirukkural he wouldn't definitely be an<br />
arrogant.<br />
<br />
So Prabanchan must be arrogant that disagreeing the<br />
mass opinion.<br />

 <br />
  Ok here's my tuppence worth. <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is a work of<br />
  historical fiction. No one can<br />
  refute that and if Mr. Prapancham has said something<br />
  like that, it is either<br />
  out of ignorance (which I don't think is the case)<br />
  or out of arrogance<br />
  (which might be the case). However, despite that, we<br />
  have to realize that he<br />
  is entitled to his views just the same as all of us.<br />
  If we all love <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> and<br />
  Kalki's works, it doesn't mean that anyone who<br />
  disagrees with us or<br />
  disparages his works is bad or wrong. That is just<br />
  his opinion, just as the<br />
  fact that we think <acronym title="Ponniyin Selvan">PS</acronym> is good is just our opinion.<br />
  Also, one doesn't need to<br />
  be a cricket player to critique cricket or bash<br />
  Ganguly now, does one? Or be<br />
  a politician to comment on politics. <img src='/img/common/smileys/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='smiley' />  Similarly,<br />
  <acronym title="In my humble opinion">IMHO</acronym>, one does not need<br />
  to be a great writer to critique novels.<br />

      ====================<br />
    Dear Sridhar,<br />
   <br />
    I skimmed through the entire recordings as put on<br />
  mail.<br />
   <br />
    If one goes through the replies of the person aged<br />
  about 56 to<br />
    various questions, the concentration is more on<br />
  Love / Women /<br />
    Actressess and the alike..<br />
   <br />
    Any further discussion on this will only drag us<br />
  out of scope of our<br />
    main line of communications ...<br />
   <br />
    There is one Thi.Sa.Raaju - elderly Ex.Serviceman<br />
  - at Thillaisthanam<br />
    (near Thiruvaiyaru) - who wrote some interesting<br />
  Social Novels with<br />
    Army back-ground. One Novel was "Mannil theiryuthu<br />
  Vaanam" in mid<br />
    70s. This Quote was from Ramakrishna paramahamsa<br />
  ... forerunner for<br />
    titles like "vaanam vasappadum" etc.<br />
   <br />
    I met Thi.Sa.Raju about a decade back. Not in<br />
  touch all these years ..<br />
   <br />
    As mentioned earlier in one of my mails, there are<br />
  about 40 names to<br />
    Rajarajan - chosen by he himself, yet Kalki found<br />
  the most enchanting<br />
    name : P O N N I Y I N S E L V A N - which <acronym title="Raja Raja Cholan">RR</acronym><br />
  himself could not<br />
    find!<br />
   <br />
    Let our neos find proper title for their works<br />
  first .. then they<br />
    comment on acknowledged ones ..<br />
